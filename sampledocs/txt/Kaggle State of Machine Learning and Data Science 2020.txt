2020 Enterprise Executive Summary Report

Table of Contents

Overview
For the fourth year, Kaggle surveyed its community of data
enthusiasts to share trends within a quickly growing field.
Based on responses from 20,036 Kaggle members,
we’ve created this report focused on the 13% (2,675
respondents) who are currently employed as data
scientists. 


We can see a clear picture of what is common in the
community but also the diverse attributes of its members.

Report
Methodology
The content of this report focuses on respondents who are
currently employed and chose their current job title as
“data scientist”. There are many other job titles that
support data science and machine learning workflows and
you can find their responses in the complete 2020 survey
dataset on Kaggle.


Many survey questions were multiple choice with the
ability for respondents to select all options that applied to
them. For that reason, you may see visualizations where
the total percentage is more than 100%. All monetary
amounts captured in the report are in USD.

Data Scientist Profile
Gender
Data science is still suffering from a large gender gap in the
workplace, as 82% of users identify as men. This is only a
slight change from last year’s results, where 84% of users
identified as males. This is the first year we’ve
differentiated between “Nonbinary” and “Prefer to
self-describe,” with each answer coming in around a third
of a percent.

Age
Similar to 2019 results, data scientists tend to be in their
late 20s or early 30s, with about 60% between 22 and 34.
Only one in five professional data scientists are 40 or older.
There are signs of the numbers skewing even younger, as
generation Z gets more involved. Nearly 7% of data
scientists are aged 18-21, an increase from last year’s 5%.


Though not included in this chart, responses from students
have also increased each year (26.8% in 2020, 21% in 2019,
22.9% in 2018). As these students graduate into the
workforce, we may see future surveys with even younger
data scientists.

Python-based tools continue to dominate the machine
learning frameworks. Scikit-learn, a swiss army knife
applicable to most projects, is the top with four in five data
scientists using it. TensorFlow and Keras, notably used in
combination for deep learning, were each selected on
about half of the data scientist surveys. Gradient boosting
library xgboost is fourth, with about the same usage as
2019.

The fifth place tool, PyTorch, climbed above 30%, up from
about 26% in 2019.


The most popular of the tools added to the survey this year
is R-based Tidymodels, reaching over 7 percent.

There are clearly three big players in cloud computing, and
it’s no surprise who: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud
Platform, and Microsoft Azure. Notably, more data
scientists are using the cloud overall. In 2019, about 25%
had not adopted cloud computing, which decreased to 17%

Conclusion
This 2020 edition of the State of Machine Learning and
Data Science includes insights gathered from a survey of
20,036 Kaggle members. Their answers covered
demographic, education, employment, and technology
usage.


The charts and results are culled from professional data
scientists (covering 13% of respondents). There’s even
more to uncover in the most comprehensive dataset
available on the state of machine learning and data science
today.


Kaggle has published the complete dataset of responses
for the community to review, and we’ll run a competition
from November 18, 2020 to January 6, 2021 to learn even
more about data science practitioners in 2020.
