Machine Learning
• Enables computers to "learn" over time
• Using algorithms & mathematical models to simulate neural networks in the
human brain
• Allows computers to extract patterns from raw data rather than following
specific instructions
• Gives the appearance of being closer to the activities of the human brain
• Some insurance companies amass large amounts of data
• Yet, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
most insurers use only 10 to 15% of the data they collect

Key Emerging Technologies Leveraged by Insurtech Companies
• Machine learning could allow insurers to mine their data more effectively
and extract valuable information
• Risk modeling: Analyze claims data to predict the risk of future losses
• Demand modeling: Predict demand for their products in the future and
to estimate premiums
• Detecting fraud: Identify patterns of behavior that aren't obvious to
human adjusters
• Processing claims: Automate claim reporting and processing
• Underwriting: Help underwriters analyze data collected from applicants.
• Computers can aid in the decision making process, flag risks or
inconsistencies in data that underwriters might not be able to see
• Can also check external sources such as social media to verify the

Classification of Insurtech Companies
Professor Christopher Geczy, PhD

Segmentation of Insurtech Firms
• There are different classification methods for InsurTech firms and
initiatives, but they rotate to similar concepts:
• A “traditional” view: Full-stack / Agents / Brokers
• A nuanced view of sub-segments: Carriers / Enablers / Distributors

67

Segmentation of Insurtech Firms
• Milken Institute has three main classifications:
• Full-stack Insurers: Platforms that underwrite policies, assume the risk,
and, in most cases, manage the process from beginning to end
• Agents: Platforms that act on behalf of a carrier, essentially acting as an
extension of an incumbent carrier
• Brokers: Platforms that provide customers with a variety of policies
offered by both incumbent carriers and insurgent InsurTech platforms
• May or may not be paid commission based on the policies sold
through their platform
• May require customers to scroll through policies offered or
automatically connect customers to a preferred policy through
algorithms employed & based on a user’s response to a set of
questions
Milken Institute, “InsurTech Rising: A Profile of the InsurTech Landscape,” December 2018.
68

Segmentation of Insurtech Firms
• To make the classification:

Yes: It is an insurer
Is it a full insurance
company?

One: It is an agent
No: Is it partnered with
one or multiple
insurance companies?
Multiple: It is a broker

Milken Institute, “InsurTech Rising: A Profile of the InsurTech Landscape,” December 2018.

• Distributors
