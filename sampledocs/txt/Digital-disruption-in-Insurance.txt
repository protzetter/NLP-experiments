Preface
There is a lot of noise out there. Insurance CEOs constantly hear about digital marketing,
digital distribution, digital IT architecture, and digital attackers, as well as digital technologies
such as telematics, automation, and machine learning, to name but a few hot topics. What is
harder for them to discern is the bigger picture. What does success look like for an insurer in a
digital world, and how is it achieved?
This compendium—“Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise”—helps
paint that picture by drawing on McKinsey’s experience in the industry and that of some 30
executives whom we interviewed. Importantly, we spoke not just to incumbents but those who
are helping to force change in the industry, including for example giant technology companies,
companies that promote the use of data-collecting sensors in our homes and cars, and
newcomers to insurance. All shared their insights on what is happening in insurance and why,
and where success lies.
The compendium’s underlying premise is stark—but some executives are beginning to face up
to it. They know that staying competitive in a digital word will require far more than the addition
of a direct sales channel or a few automated processes. Even the term “digital transformation”
can underplay the response required, suggesting as it does that the change needed is purely
technological. What is actually required is a fundamental rethink of the corporation, for which
digital technology is but the catalyst. It forces companies to rethink the sources of revenue and
efficiency. It forces them to rethink the organizational and talent model. And ultimately it forces
them to rethink the business model and the role they will play in an ecosystem that cuts across
traditional industry boundaries. They will have to reinvent themselves.
Resistance to what lies ahead is futile. Insurance has been relatively slow to feel the digital
effect owing to regulation, large in-force books, and the fact that newcomers seldom have
the capital needed to take insurance risk on to their balance sheets. But the industry is not
impregnable. Companies that fail to adapt will weaken under the pressure exerted by those
that use digital technology to slash costs and get better returns on their investments. And they
will be left floundering once digital’s relentless force ultimately breaches both the industry’s
business model and boundaries. Already, in personal auto insurance, we see how sensors
fitted in vehicles will be likely to put premiums under pressure as driving becomes safer. And
we have only to glance at other industries to understand how, in a world in which data and
analytics are king, powerful new digital competitors with large customer bases in their core
businesses can rapidly invade new ones. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba now also owns
one of the world’s largest technology finance company, with financial services and products
that include insurance.

Acknowledging the urgency to undertake a digital transformation—both to reap its rewards and
fend off threats—is one thing. Knowing how to manage one is quite another. Ask any executive
who is the midst of the task, and they will attest that it is a formidable effort that touches every part
of the organization, and that there is no rule book that will guarantee an easy ride. This remains
virgin territory because no one in insurance has yet completed a transformation—it could take
as long as a decade. Nevertheless, lessons are emerging that will answer the burning questions
posed by those about to embark on the challenge, questions such as:
 Where should I start, with cost-cutting or growth initiatives? And should I let a thousand flowers
boom, or pick selectively?
 Do I need to rip out my IT systems and start again?
 Do I need to set up a new, digital unit, and if so, will it cannibalize my other business?
 How do I attract all that new, whizzy talent I will be needing—and will these newcomers really
understand what makes my company successful?
 Do I need a chief digital officer?
 Our heritage makes us risk averse. But now I am being told we need to experiment and
innovate. How do we change—safely?
This compendium explores the answers to those questions. We hope it will help executives
to understand where value lies in a digital world, at the same time as offering a clear, practical
approach for capturing it.

Digital technology destroys value.
That might sound counterintuitive
given the extent to which it can make
business systems more efficient—and
companies are urged to embrace its many
possibilities. Yet new McKinsey research
shows that although digital technology
propels some companies to become clear
market winners, for many more its impact
depletes corporate earnings and the
overall value of an industry.1 Consumers,
not companies, are often the ultimate
winners.

Facing digital reality
Regulation, product complexity, and insurers’ large
balance sheets have kept digital attackers from insurers’
gates. That is changing, but in ways incumbents should
embrace. They can flourish in the digital age—if they move
swiftly and decisively.

6

Facing digital reality

So it is likely to be in insurance. For a long
time, the traditional insurance business
model has proved to be remarkably
resilient. But it too is beginning to feel
the digital effect. It is changing how
products and services are delivered, and
increasingly it will change the nature of
those products and services and even
the business model itself. We firmly
believe that opportunities abound for
incumbent insurance companies in this
new world. But they will not be evenly
shared. Those companies that move
swiftly and decisively are likely to be those
that flourish. Those that do not will find
it increasingly challenging to generate
attractive returns.

24-hour access and quick delivery, clear,
relevant information about a product’s
features, particularly in relation to
pricing, and innovative, tailored services
designed for the digital age. They have
the same expectations whatever the
service provider, insurers included.
And as Matthew Donaldson, CEO of
UK-based BGL, the company behind
the comparison site Comparethemarket,
points out, although some insurers are
holding back from the commitment
needed to meet these expectations,
demand must ultimately be satisfied.

Automation can reduce
the cost of a claims
journey by as much as

30%

The goal must be to meet customers’
expectations, which have been
transformed by digital technology.
Customers want simplicity—one-click
shopping, for example. They want

In the shorter term, fulfilling this goal is
a chance for insurers to improve profits
in their core business. Higher customer
satisfaction, driven by the improved
service and faster processing times
that digitization delivers, is itself a driver
of profit through increased customer
retention.2 At the same time, by digitizing
their existing business, carriers can
remove significant cost across the value
chain, further increasing customer lifetime
value. Automation can reduce the cost

of a claims journey by as much as 30
percent, for example.
There are revenue improvement
opportunities too. The notion that
insurance is a low-engagement,
disintermediated category in which
customer relationships can be delegated
to agents and brokers is increasingly
obsolete. Instead, digital technology and
the data and analysis it makes available
give insurers the chance to know their
customers better. That means they can
price and underwrite more accurately,
and better identify fraudulent claims.
They can also offer clients more tailored
products—auto insurance that charges
by the mile driven, for example. And they
can offer them in a more timely manner.
In an analog world, an insurer will be
unaware when a customer holding a
home insurance policy puts that home
on the market. In a data-rich digital
world, that need not be the case, and
the knowledge that a home is up for
sale becomes an opportunity to offer
new home cover, new auto cover, and
perhaps a life product to help cover a
mortgage on the new house.
Longer-term growth opportunities
reside in innovative insurance products
and protection services. Concerns
about cyber security will create demand
from companies and even households
for products that prevent and protect
against the breach or loss of data, and
damage that might ensue. And more
products fit for a sharing economy
will surely emerge—for homeowners
who suddenly become hoteliers when

“Insurers of the future
will play more of a
risk avoidance role
and less of a risk
mitigation one.”
— Andrew Rose, CEO of
US insurance comparison
website Compare.com
This is all good news for insurers,
particularly at a time when low interest
rates and tighter regulation constrain
performance. But while opportunities
abound, there is no guarantee that
today’s incumbents will be the ones
to capture them. Digital is opening the
gates to new attackers that will erode
their advantages.

want to take risk on to their balance
sheets because of the capital they need
to offset it. And they have the advantage
of underwriting skills built on years of
experience and proprietary data.

insurance (Exhibit 2). They are not about to
overturn today’s value chain. But there are
longer-term trends afoot that might.

This resilience explains why the industry
as a whole lags behind many other sectors
in its digital maturity. But the situation is
changing. Money now pouring into the
industry suggests it is no longer regarded
as impregnable. Venture capitalists
globally invested $2.6 billion in insurtechs
in 2015, and nearly $1.7 billion in 2016.
(Exhibit 1). Although these newcomers are
populating every part of the value chain,
their focus to date has been on the more
easily accessible slivers of the industry—
mainly distribution, particularly in P&C

Insurers are threatened by three trends:
a shift toward preventing risk rather
than insuring against it, the increasing
power of those companies that own and
analyze data, and the investment of huge
amounts of capital in insurance-related
capital market instruments by institutional
investors seeking high returns.

Complex regulation was and remains
a deterrent to new market entrants.
So is the size of incumbents’ in-force
books which, coupled with customers’
tendency in P&C and particularly life
insurance not to switch providers,
makes it hard for new entrants to rapidly
capture market share. Moreover,
incumbents have the advantage of large
capital reserves, as start-ups seldom

of risk, but they also help mitigate risk,
reducing premiums. Take auto insurance.
Forward collision avoidance, blind-spot
assist, and adaptive cruise control are
already fitted in many new cars, making
vehicles safer. Already, 20 percent of
vehicles globally are expected to come
with safety systems by 2020, reducing
the number of accidents and thus the
value of personal auto insurance policies.
Entirely self-driving cars could become
ubiquitous in the next two decades, at
which point liability is likely to shift from
individual drivers to manufacturers. In the
United States, we estimate auto insurance
premiums could decline by as much as 25
percent by 2035 due to the proliferation

of safety systems and semi- and fullyautonomous vehicles.
The same shift toward risk prevention is
apparent in other sectors. In the home,
sensors can send an alert to the owner if
a risk of flood is detected, automatically
shutting off the water system if there is no
response, and in commercial properties,
connected devices on manufacturing
equipment can give owners early warning
of maintenance requirements. Smart
devices that monitor health are also
increasingly popular. There are two main
effects. Data from connected devices can
be used to assess risk more accurately.
But it is also a powerful tool to lower
risk—to prevent accidents in the home,

reduce maintenance and downtime, or
improve health. This logically leads to a
model whereby consumers pay not for
premiums in order to be compensated for
damages they might incur, but for gadgets
or services that predict and help prevent
that risk. “Insurers of the future will pay
more of a risk avoidance role and less of
a risk mitigation one,” says Andrew Rose,
CEO of US insurance comparison website
Compare.com. The value creation from
underwriting thus diminishes.
The power of data and its analysis. Data
and analytics are changing the basis
of competition. Leading companies
use both not only to improve their core
operations but to launch entirely new
business models. Insurers have valuable
historic data. Yet in a few years’ time, will
they be able to keep pace and still add
underwriting value when competing with
newcomers that have access to more
insightful, often real-time new data culled
from the Internet of Things (IoT), social
media, credit card histories, and other
digital records? Knowledge about how
fast someone drives, how hard they brake,
or even (more controversially) what they
get up to as displayed on social media is
arguably more revealing data on which to
assess risk than simply age, zip code, and
past accident record. (Facebook recently
moved to prevent its users’ online activity
being used by insurers in the United
Kingdom—proof of the potential power of
access to good data.)
And what if those with the necessary
data and analytical skills and platforms
that reach millions—a Google or an
Amazon—not only offered well-targeted,
tailored products, but also began to
cherry-pick low-risk customers? If they
did so in significant numbers, the insurers’

business model, whereby premiums
collected from low-risk policyholders
contribute to the claims of high-risk ones,
could fall apart.
Auto manufacturers are arguably close
to changing the game for insurers. The
fitting of connected devices as standard
in cars is not far off, potentially giving
manufacturers unique access to data that
could accurately ascertain the risk of their
customers, as well as ready-made access
to drivers in need of an insurance product.
How would incumbents fare in such an
evolving ecosystem?

Leading companies
are using data and
analytics not only to
improve their core
operations but to
launch entirely new
business models.
Institutional investors. For more than a
decade, large institutional investors have
been pouring money into insurancelinked instruments on the capital markets
in search of non-correlated returns
and higher yields in a low interest rate
environment, disintermediating reinsurers
in the process. To date, they have
focused mainly on reinsuring property
catastrophe risk—a sum of $70 billion in
2015. But now they have their eyes on the
primary market. For the moment, interest
centers on “short-tail” lines of business.
Yet ultimately, why would, say, a large
manufacturer of sensors that gathered

data about weather and soil conditions
to optimize agricultural productivity
not consider offering a crop insurance
product to farmers, with the backing of
investors? The data gathered would aid
risk analysis, and payments could be
triggered automatically (and cheaply)
when sensors detected damaging
weather conditions.

A large incumbent
could more than
double profits over
5 years by digitizing
existing business.
Despite these potential threats, our view is
that today’s carriers, many of which have
a century-old record of creating value
for their policyholders and shareholders,
remain in a strong position to flourish in a
digital age. For the time being, they have
expertise no one else has, making them
valuable partners in the ecosystems
that are evolving to offer consumers
both risk prevention and risk mitigation
services. They still have large balance
sheets that enable them to underwrite
large pools of risk. And they have the trust
of policyholders who need to know their
insurance company will still exist when
they make a claim or their policies mature,
perhaps decades from now.

of just one or two innovation cycles. Retail
music, book stores, travel, and media
are some of the high-profile sectors that
have already felt its force, transforming
their economics and sometimes toppling
what were once industry heavyweights.
The question for incumbents is therefore
whether they are nimble enough to rise
to the opportunities that digital offers.
The evidence that they will need to move
quickly is compelling.

could more than double profits over
the course of five years. In the longer
term, however, earnings from traditional
business will face headwinds as driving
becomes less risky owing to the use of
sensors and telematics or because, in
the case of autonomous cars, liability
is transferred to manufacturers. Fifteen
years on, profits for traditional personal
lines auto might fall by 40 percent or more
from their peak (Exhibit 3).

Second, in a digital economy, the
effects of a shrinking economic pie are
compounded by the fact that the pie
will not be evenly divided—the result of
economies of scale and network effects.
Hence, not all carriers will be able to
sustain the performance described in the
analysis above. For many, digital’s threats
might well outweigh the opportunities.
Again, the signs are already apparent. In
direct auto insurance in Spain, Germany,

Uneven distribution of rewards
First, digital diminishes value. McKinsey’s
global survey of a wide range of industries
has shown that digital technology
shrinks revenue growth at an average
rate of 3.5 percent a year and growth in
earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) at
an average rate of 1 percent a year. For
some industries, the figure is as high as
12 percent for revenue and 10 percent for
EBIT.
Our analysis of auto cover, the insurance
segment that has been first to feel digital’s
impact, suggests a similar dynamic
is unfolding in the insurance industry.
US auto insurers have already lost on
average $4.2 billion in underwriting profit
a year over the past five, with expenses
and losses consistently outweighing
premiums. They should expect further
annual profit declines of between 0.5
and 1 percent if they fail to use digital
technology to improve efficiency and
effectiveness.

and the United States, a single player has
captured the lion’s share of profits, up to
70 percent, leaving a long tail of sub-scale,
often unprofitable carriers competing for
the remainder (Exhibit 4).
Third, the winners will be those that move
decisively. Our cross-industry research
showed that those companies that
initiated disruption fared best, generating
revenue and EBIT growth that was on
average between one and two percentage
points higher than that of more ad hoc
responders. These companies made big

bets—to innovate products or reshape
the value chain, for example—rather than
following in others’ wake. In insurance, this

offering superior products and services.
Technical underwriting skills alone will not
suffice.

Technological leadership and innovation.
Winning companies will need to do more
than follow technological trends and
innovation. They will need to lead them.
Innovation is a vital component of a digital
transformation.

margins under pressure as premiums fall
under the weight of price competition and
as new ways of mitigating risk emerge.
Under these conditions, insurers will need
to harness digital to make their operations
more efficient, aggressively lowering costs.
They will also need to make them more
effective by, for example, improving the
accuracy of their pricing and underwriting
to improve loss ratios.

not had to worry much about customer

Against this backdrop, we interviewed
some 30 executives in incumbent and
attacking companies to understand their
views on how the industry is changing
and how to respond. The single message
most constantly repeated was the
need for incumbents to accelerate their
response (see box, “The need to commit
to speed”). Most know they cannot afford
to wait until evolving technologies turn the
market upside down and the competitive
advantages they enjoy today evaporate.
If history tells them anything, it is that
they need to get ahead of the curve. And
they will need to do so at scale, ultimately
transforming the entire business. What
holds them back, however, is deciding how
to address the challenge given its enormity.

“I believe the
consumer will win
and that the desire for
low-cost, transparent,
high-quality digital
services will have to
be met.”

VOICES: The need to commit to speed
“There are times when we talk to carriers about integrating a line of
code into their app to integrate more into Facebook, and the answer
we get is, ‘Well, our next release cycle isn’t for another eight months.’
The ability to speed up those release cycles is a variable that we see
with those carriers that are not just talking the talk, but taking action.”
—Brad Auerbach, US industry manager, Facebook
“You have to believe that tomorrow somebody’s going to attack you.
And you have to be acting very, very fast. The second that you slow
down, somebody’s going to pass you. Insurance companies operate
on slower timescales. You can’t do that. The market will pass you by.”
—Andrew Rose, president and CEO, Compare.com
“Companies need to commit to speed. Insurance is a highly regulated
industry and it is not easy to move quickly, but the fact is consumers
are moving at exceptional rates. So the companies that will stand
out are the ones that are going to find ways to move a bit faster, at the
pace of the people they’re insuring.”—Scott Simony, head of industry,
Google
“We see some carriers that understand this is the beginning of a
reinvention of the auto insurance model, but we also see many that are
still scared of technology, a bit like the utility world was a few years ago,
where people said, ‘You know what, I’m fine running my coal plants, I
don’t want to know about all this renewable technology because it’s
only going to hit in the generation after I retire.’ But car makers are
adopting the technology quite rapidly. Five, ten years out we’re going to
see some very, very major effects.”—Stefan Heck, CEO, Nauto
“Insurance companies that are really good at risk management are
thinking traditionally—that if you spend enough time, one year, two
years, thinking and planning, the outcomes you generate would
be [the result of ] the time spent. But the pace of change is so fast
that by the time you have thought through things, the market may
have already moved on.”—Naveen Agarwal, chief customer officer,
Prudential

barrier to entry for others. Some companies
have built hyper-scale data platforms that
enable them to blur traditional industry
definitions by spanning product categories
and customer segments, creating new
ecosystems and value chains in the
process.
Speed and agility. The strength of an
insurer’s in-force book will not protect it
indefinitely. Incumbents need to move
quickly to compete with digital competitors
that have the agility to keep pace with
evolving technology and customer needs.
That means letting go of slow decisionmaking processes and outdated ways of
working, and adopting a new culture and
talent base that is more comfortable with
experimentation, testing and learning, and
sometimes even with failing.

Insurers should not underestimate the
changes that digital will bring to their
industry and the challenges they will
pose. Neither should they overlook the
significant short-term profit improvements
that are within their grasp if they digitize
their core businesses, nor shy away from
innovating to be part of an exciting future
that is unfolding for the industry. If they act
decisively, they will be among its leaders.

A roadmap for the future
These new value drivers will inform the

forces that are disrupting the industry.
They will make clear the huge value to
be created by digitizing their current
businesses, as well as the imperative to
innovate. They will demonstrate the need
for significant investments in IT and a
change in perspective whereby IT becomes
a strategic function, not a cost center. They
will make plain the new capabilities required
to take full advantage of IT’s potential,
including automation, advanced analytics,

importance of culture and talent change if
the transformation is to be successful.

17

The verdict is clear: those insurance
companies with the most advanced
management practices related to digital
strategy, capabilities, culture, and
organization outperform their peers.1
Yet relatively few incumbents have so
far defined a comprehensive digital
strategy—the foundation from which
all else logically follows if they are to
compete in a digital world. Instead, they
package together tactical or incremental
initiatives that individually drive modest
performance improvement—some
digital marketing, a new sales channel, or
some degree of automation, perhaps—
while leaving significant value potential
untapped and their futures in doubt.

A strategy for a digital age
Few insurers have defined a comprehensive digital strategy
fit to withstand attackers at the gate. The starting point is to
understand the sources of disruption.

Why? Part of the answer lies in the extent
to which carriers have been protected by
regulation and the strength of their in-force
books. In addition, CEOs with limited
tenures might be wary of upsetting what
has served them relatively well—and are
likely to be more circumspect when the
future is so uncertain. With competitive
landscapes changing fast, it can be hard
to know just how digital technology will
play out, and hence where to place big
bets. Yet hesitation is not an option. In
insurance, as in other industries that have
felt the force of digital disruption, those
that move fastest to adapt are likely to take
a disproportionate share of the profits.
Hence, a means of discerning clearly the
sources of opportunity and disruption
in digital technology lies at the core of a

digital strategy, and is critical to building a
leadership position.

Building a digital strategy
The definition of a digital strategy is no
different from that of any other strategy.
It is a set of integrated, hard-to-reverse
choices, made for the future, in the face of
uncertainty, with the purpose of creating
and capturing economic surplus.2

With competitive
landscapes
changing fast, it can
be hard to know
just how digital
technology will
play out, and hence
where to place big
bets.
The building blocks of a digital strategy
likewise resemble those of any other
strategy: a diagnosis of where and why a
company makes money in the present,
a forecast of how that might alter in the
future, an understanding of the potential
pathways to success, a portfolio of
initiatives, and then a commitment to
driving change.

strategically,” McKinsey Quarterly, June 2000.

All these considerations will transform
certain aspects of how companies
manage their strategies, even though
the foundations remain the same. In the
first instance, companies need to be
bolder. A McKinsey survey of more than
2,000 executives in industries affected
by digital technology shows that the
companies with the highest revenue
and earnings growth looked for digital
opportunities across all elements of their
business model, not just one or two,
and either led the disruption or were fast

Companies that procrastinate over such
bets risk disappearing. In insurance, as
in other industries, it takes a while for
customers and companies to embrace
digital technology, but as the pace of
change accelerates incumbents’ scope
to adapt diminishes. There comes a
tipping point where those that have not
adapted their strategies fade away—as
in traditional print media, for example.
The insurance industry might have been
relatively slow to feel the digital effect,
but personal lines in P&C cover look set
on a steep trajectory toward the tipping
point, with small commercial lines
just behind. Life insurance and large
commercial insurance, with longer-term,
often more complex contracts, have
further to go (see Exhibit 1).

What is different in a digital age is the
speed and potential magnitude of
that change, upending old business
models and rapidly building entirely
new ones. Circumventing the need
to build traditional fixed assets, the
likes of Amazon, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb,
and a host of fintechs have disrupted
incumbents in the space of a few years
by using digital technologies, data, and
analytics to create value without owning,
respectively, physical shops, cable
connections to viewers’ homes, car
fleets, hotels, or bank branches.

Second, companies need to review their
strategies frequently as technology,
consumer behavior, and competitors
evolve ever more rapidly. The five year
strategic review—once a staple of
board-level strategies—is increasingly
outdated. Recall that five years ago, the
iPad, now ubiquitous, had been on the
market for only 18 months, Netflix stock
was taking a beating after the company
suggested it would spin off its DVD
delivery business, and Spotify had just
launched in the United States.
Third, companies need to build a wider
range of strategic options because
conditions can change so quickly.

Focus on digitizing
existing business model

And fourth, when conditions do change,
they will need the discipline and agility
to reallocate management time and
resources swiftly. As Klaus Schwab,
chairman of the World Economic Forum,
memorably said, “In the new world, it is not
the big fish which eats the small fish, it’s
the fast fish which eats the slow fish.”

services, and business models

hold. The problem here, however, is that
there are hundreds of insurtechs to track,
with more appearing as venture capital
pours into the industry (to the tune of $1.7
billion). They cannot all be monitored,
and it is a sure bet that although some will
succeed, most will vanish. It is therefore
important to focus on the nature of the
disruption rather than on the would-be
disruptors, with a view to getting ahead
of it—in other words companies must
understand both what is happening,
and why. Only in this way, according to
Tom King, senior director at US software
company Pegasystems, will insurers be
able to respond promptly to changes in
the market.
Our research suggests that digital
technology can disrupt in four, nonmutually exclusive, ways. It can transform
the cost structure of a business system.
It can disrupt supply and demand. It
can create new value propositions and
markets. And it can create hyper-scale
digital platforms. There are thus four
questions companies should ask in order
to start building a strategy.
1. To what extent will digital technology
transform the cost structure of the
business system?
Netflix took movie rentals and rethought
the business around them, then went
from DVD delivery to owning one of the
world’s largest video streaming services.
In a digital world, all businesses are likely
to be disrupted if they rely on a physical
distribution network and involve manual
processes that can be automated. It is
easy to see how traditional insurance
models, often reliant on agents with

22

A strategy for a digital age

commissions, could be attacked by
companies that are able to automate
advisory processes and apply advanced
analytics to improve pricing and
underwriting. McKinsey estimates that
up to 40 percent of P&C and life insurers’
expenses are locked up in their top 20 to
30 core end-to-end processes—costs
that digitization can reduce, and in some
cases, eliminate.

“It doesn’t matter how
much business you
sell today, it’s whether
or not you can identify
where [future] profits
and losses lie, and
what you need to
jettison.”
– Tom King, senior director
at US software company
Pegasystems
2. To what extent will digital technology
disrupt supply and demand?
In the analog world, economics can make
it hard to cater precisely to individual
demand. Think of the hefty package of
supplements bundled together in Sunday
newspapers. Most consumers do not
read everything, but the economics of
distribution mean they get it anyway.

Digital technology can cater to demand
more precisely so that customers are
no longer obliged to buy elements of a
package they do not want. iTunes makes
it unnecessary to buy a whole album,
for example. This unbundling makes
businesses vulnerable to disruption,
particularly if they cross-subsidize parts
of their offering, as insurers do, with direct
sales channels covering the cost of more
expensive agency channels.
Aware of what is afoot, some carriers,
such as Progressive, enable customers to
“name their price” and choose elements
of a policy that fit their budget—the level
of deductibles, for example. Some offer
pay-as-you-go auto insurance whereby
drivers are charged by the mile. And
some use data on, for example, driving
habits, to price products in a way that
more precisely reflects an individual’s
risk. These developments amount to an
“unbundling” of coverage, better matching
the protection provided to the protection
required.
Digital technology also has the power
to unleash supply. YouTube has made
it easy and inexpensive for millions of
individuals to become published video
producers, unlocking a supply of content
that previously would have been too
costly to distribute. In insurance, complex
regulation and capital requirements have
restricted supply in primary markets as
start-ups seldom want to take insurance
risk on to their balance sheets. But startups are targeting accessible slivers of
the industry, primarily marketing and
distribution. And institutional investors
are hovering. They have already

poured money into insurance-linked
instruments on the capital markets
in search of non-correlated returns
and higher yields, disintermediating
reinsurers in the process. Some are now
investing in primary markets, a move
that digital technology could accelerate.
It is conceivable, for example, that a
manufacturer of sensors that gather
data about weather conditions in order
to optimize fertilization could turn to
investors to back an insurance product for
crops, using the same sensors to indicate
whether weather conditions were harsh
enough to damage them.
3. To what extent will digital technology
give birth to new value propositions
and markets?
There are myriad ways of using digital
technology to improve value and offer new
propositions, such as making purchases
simpler and faster, adding fresh elements
to a product or service, using data
and analytics to make products more
relevant, or removing costs incurred by
intermediaries. Examples are emerging
of carriers using it to reward consumers

23

with benefits for behaving in a way that
aligns with their own interests—such
as US insurer John Hancock offering
customers discounts on products and
services, as well as lower premiums, in
return for leading healthy lifestyles. Some
digital attackers are making it possible
to buy complex products such as life
insurance online, while others are using
internet crowd sourcing to negotiate better
deals with insurers for “long-tail” insurance
products. Policies for pug dogs and
diabetic travelers fall into this category.

New value
propositions can lead
to the establishment
of new markets, by
matching supply
and demand in
pioneering ways.
And there are new products for new
risks—protection against cyber risk, for
example, or cover for “sharing economy”
risks such as those to which car owners
are exposed when they decide to become
cab drivers for Uber.
Some value propositions are emerging
that threaten to undermine the existing
insurance model. The more real-time data
becomes available, from sensors in cars
or on drones, devices installed in homes,
or monitors worn on our bodies, the more

24

A strategy for a digital age

companies can learn from the analysis of
that data and the more it will be possible to
mitigate risk, reducing the need to insure
against it. That hits the volume of demand,
but risk mitigation becomes a new value
proposition in the process.
New value propositions can also lead
to the establishment of new markets,
by matching supply and demand in
pioneering ways. The likes of Uber, Lyft,
and the Chinese ride-sharing company
Didi Chuxing use digital platforms with
location-based mapping technology
to match would-be passengers with
the drivers in closest proximity, along
with analytics to make dynamic pricing
adjustments and encourage drivers to
meet demand in peak periods. It is a far
cry from passengers trying to hail a taxi
in the street. In insurance, online price
aggregators have established markets
to help consumers compare prices and
bypass the traditional agent distribution
model.
4. Will digital technology give birth to
hyper-scale platforms?
Digital technology can give rise to
companies that build platforms on a
massive scale. Their size, the huge
amounts of data they amass, and the
depth of analytical talent they deploy—
along with the network effects they
generate—are hard for others to match
and thus create barriers to entry.
Moreover, these companies’ skills and
capabilities enable them to blur traditional
industry definitions by spanning product
categories and customer segments and

inventing new value chains. For example,
Uber has signed a deal with Volvo to
invest in the development of self-driving
taxis in the United States; testing began in
Pittsburgh in September 2016.3 Apple has
used its unique data, infrastructure, and
product platform to push into the world
of finance with Apple Pay. And Chinese
e-commerce giants Alibaba, Tencent, and
JD.com have leveraged their volumes of
data to offer microloans to the merchants
that operate on their platforms. By using
real-time data on merchants’ transactions
to build its own credit scoring system,
Alibaba’s finance arm has been able to
achieve better non-performing loan ratios
than traditional banks.4
Insurers will need to consider what
their role might be in the ecosystems
developing around these data platforms,
and where value lies in owning and
analyzing data.5 Will, say, a large car
manufacturer that fits sensors as
standard in vehicles amass enough data
to dominate an ecosystem that brings
together insurers and other service
providers such as telecom companies,
repair shops, road side assistance,
telematics providers, and legal services?

forces and analyzing the value at stake will

reveal the need for a portfolio of initiatives
that grapple simultaneously with two
strategic imperatives.
The first is the need to capture short-term
value. In the early stages of disruption,
digital technology invariably starts to
transform the cost structure of the
business system and disrupt supply and
demand, posing opportunities and threats
to incumbents. To respond, they will need
to digitize their businesses in order to
cut costs, grow revenues, and improve
the customer experience. Essentially,
however, the business model will remain
the same.

By understanding
the catalysts for
disruption and
regularly reviewing
their businesses,
companies will be
able to lead the wave
of disruption as it
gathers strength, not
drown in it.
Drawing up a heat map that examines
the value at stake throughout every
business line will indicate the extent of
the opportunity—the cost savings an
auto carrier could make by digitizing and

automating the claims process, say—as
well as the threat if it fails to respond—the
fall in profits that would ensue if customers
were to gravitate toward price-driven
aggregators and comparison sites,
for example. The “hot spots” will help
a company decide where to prioritize
initiatives, although this will depend also
upon whether it has the capabilities to
pursue them, and upon regulatory issues.
The second strategic imperative will be
to look beyond today’s business for fresh
sources of value. Pondering the potential
for new value propositions and markets,
and for hyper-scale platforms will suggest
how digital technology might disrupt
not just elements of the value chain but
the entire business model. The higher
up the digital curve a business line rises,
the more imminent such disruption is
likely to be, and the greater the need for
innovation. The exhibit shows how the
strategic focus shifts as digital’s influence
on an industry grows. In P&C lines it is
already apparent that the traditional model
is being reshaped by data and analytics
that make it easier to mitigate the risks we
insure against today. By understanding
the catalysts for disruption and regularly
reviewing their businesses, companies will
be able to lead the wave of disruption as it
gathers strength, not drown in it.

innovating for the future risks cannibalizing
profits in the here and now, along with
organizational upheaval.
The answer lies not in reverting to a
strategy of incremental improvement.
Competition in a digital age rules this
out. Rather, it entails fully grasping where
value lies, in order to shape and sequence
initiatives in ways that meet strategic
imperatives while maximizing quick paybacks to protect the performance of the
business. Understanding the catalysts
of change has to be the starting point,
helping to reveal where value-creating
opportunities lie and where value is at risk,
and ensuring companies disrupt before
they are disrupted.

The age of innovation
Insurers have a choice: be disrupted or be the disruptor
with new products, services, and business models.

Delivering on these imperatives will prove
a hard balancing act for CEOs, faced
with the constant pressure of the next
earnings report. Although digitizing the
existing business will reap rewards, it can
require significant investment that pays
off after several years. At the same time,

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

27

Digital technology is disrupting industry
after industry—and quickly separating
winners from losers. The spoils are going
to the boldest innovators. A McKinsey
survey of more than 2,000 executives in
industries affected by digital disruption
shows that the companies with the
highest revenue and earnings growth
led the disruption or were fast followers,
making big bets across their businesses
on innovative products, digital processes,
and even entirely new business models.
Most insurers, though, do not have
innovation in their DNA. Regulation has
curbed incumbents’ ability to experiment,
while limited competition has given them
no particular need to do so—the size
of their in-force books makes it hard for
new entrants to build market share, and
start-ups seldom want to take risk on
to their balance sheets because of the
capital required to offset it. But innovate
they must. Although there is significant
opportunity to capture value in the
short term by digitizing their current
business, they will get left behind if they fail
simultaneously to use digital technology to
innovate and build new business.
Exhibit 1 shows where insurtechs are
concentrating their innovation efforts.
To help companies think through
where innovation lies, we look at three
broad areas—new kinds of risk, new
approaches to underwriting, and new
value propositions. And we discuss how
companies are organizing themselves to
develop ideas and accelerate innovation.

compromised. Consumers too are at
risk, from identity theft, loss of financial
assets, and unauthorized credit card
use. Opportunities for carriers include

providers (see box, “The cybersecurity

for companies to source supplies,
manufacture goods, and sell their
wares anywhere in the world. But the
rising complexity of supply chains also
multiplies risk. There are more points of
vulnerability, and disruption in any part
of the chain can quickly affect the entire
business. There is thus growing
demand for equally sophisticated
supply chain cover.

Digital technology not only creates
the risk, it also provides many of the
solutions. Using the connected sensors
and monitors that comprise the Internet
of Things (IoT), it is possible to track the
location of inventory and finished goods
as they travel on trucks, ships, and
planes. Predictive analytics can then
be applied to data on claims, weather,
and other factors to enable insurers to
underwrite the supply chain risk more
precisely.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

29

The cybersecurity opportunity—that few are seizing
Cybercrime presents rapidly multiplying risks for businesses and consumers. Having
almost quadrupled between 2012 and 2015, from $112 billion to more than $400 billion,1
the estimated cost of cyber breaches is projected to reach $2 trillion in 2019, or almost as
much as India’s GDP for 2015.2
Yet the insurance industry has not leaped at the opportunity to sell protection against this
new risk. The global insurance pool in 2015, according to Lloyds, was just $2.5 billion.
Part of the problem is demand; awareness of the risk remains limited. There are also
supply-side issues. Insurers are unsure how to model cybersecurity risk and still have
not decided what they can cover economically. Few have written “full” cyber cover to
compensate customers for all possible losses, including data theft, business disruption,
property damage, and personal injury, and a lack of reliable information on historical
breaches makes pricing difficult. Moreover, there are few standards for cover and the law
differs according to jurisdiction. Perhaps most important, technology and the capabilities
of hackers continue to evolve more rapidly than cybercrime protection methods.
Nonetheless, a risk this large should be the basis for a successful line of business
for companies that are able to innovate. They would need to invest in understanding
the drivers of cyber risk, which would require them to hire experts who understand
the technical issues as well as the underwriting process, or enter partnerships
with organizations that have those capabilities. They would also need to develop
comprehensive histories of cybersecurity breaches and create compliance frameworks
to measure enterprise risk. Given the magnitude of the risks involved, though,
incumbents with strong balance sheets could have an advantage in cybercrime
insurance.

New solutions are emerging. For car
rides, Uber supplies drivers with limited
liability cover when its app is turned on
and a driver is available. Its commercial
cover kicks in when a fare enters the
car. For drivers of BlaBlaCars (a service
that operates in France and the United
Kingdom), Axa offers a combined
personal and commercial package.
Various forms of cover are emerging for
homeowners participating in Airbnb and
other short-term home rental platforms
such as Alterkeys and 9Flats.com. The
platforms offer protection for damage by
tenants that cannot be resolved by the
owner, but with significant exclusions.
Carriers such as US-based Proper, which
have long offered insurance to owners
of vacation rental properties, are adding
cover for short-term rentals. Still, most
traditional homeowner policies do not
cover commercial uses of properties. As
the sharing economy grows, there will
surely be more opportunities to innovate
and provide relevant insurance products.

New underwriting approaches
Digital technologies enable new ways to
provide traditional cover and underwrite
traditional risks, often by using individual
rather than group data. They are also
being used to reach new customers.

“We ... create
communities of
individuals, on
whose behalf we
negotiate with the
insurance industry to
bring them a better
deal than they could
get on their own.”
—Steven Mendel, founder
and CEO of Bought By

problem. For example, they are enabling
a form of low-cost, micro-crop insurance
for farmers in emerging economies that
does not require claims adjusters to trek to
remote locations to settle claims. Instead,
insurers use data analytics to determine
if severe weather, low rainfall, or other
factors would have damaged crops, and
pay claims based on their analysis. This
vastly reduces settlement costs, making
it possible for insurers to offer affordable
policies to farmers in the developing world.

New kinds of risk are emerging from the

consumers to “share” unused capacity
(a car ride, the use of a spare room) for
a fee. This turns a car owner into a cab
driver and a homeowner into a hotelier,
and alters the nature of the insurance
cover that the driver and homeowner
require.

for small amounts of cover. New data

on-demand cover for short periods. Sure,
for example, is a mobile app for episodic
travel accident insurance bought on the
spot. Travelers look up their flights, enter
their personal data, and purchase cover
for the duration of the flight.
European telecom operator Tele2
offers travel insurance in partnership
with Gjensidige, a Nordic insurer, for
motorists whose insurance extends only
to domestic travel. When a driver crosses
a border—from Poland to Germany, say—
the insurer issues a text message offering
episodic cover while the vehicle is out of
Poland. Another start-up, San Franciscobased Trov, has an app that enables
consumers to buy short-term insurance
on demand against loss or damage for
items such as sports equipment and
computers. If they are about to take a ride
on an expensive bike or take a laptop on
a vacation, the app can be used to switch
the cover on and off. Another emerging
form of on-demand insurance is usagebased or pay-as-you-go cover—auto

will be donated. The idea is that peer
group members who share an interest
in maximizing contributions to their
causes will not attempt to inflate claims.
One of the company’s executives is
behavioral scientist Dan Ariely, who says
the Lemonade approach removes the
conflict between carrier and the insured
that is inherent in traditional insurance. As
a result, he says that the company, which
began offering policies in September
2016, will be able to pay claims quickly
because it has less need to hold back
payment until they can be verified.

customers for a group purchase.

industry executives, organizes peer
groups around charitable and social
causes. Consumers who purchase

Lemonade’s online platform designate a

Bought By Many, a UK-based insurance
distribution company, groups those with
similar insurance needs—diabetics, for
example, who often have trouble getting
travel insurance, or owners of particular
breeds of pet. “We use a combination of
search engines and social media to create
communities of individuals, on whose
behalf we negotiate with the insurance
industry to bring them a better deal than
they could get on their own,” says the
company’s founder and CEO, Steven

Mendel (see “Playing to connectedness:
An interview with Steven Mendel of
Bought by Many”).
Personalized pricing
Digital technologies increasingly enable
carriers to assess risk on the basis of
data about specific consumers, rather
than general population data. Telematics
collect real-time information about an
individual’s driving habits to inform the
pricing of auto cover, while data from
wearable devices such as fitness bands
and apps that monitor adherence to
medical treatment can inform life cover—
services that Sureify, a tech start-up,
uses to assist carriers underwriting
personalized term life cover. Some carriers
have experimented with using social
media data as a basis for underwriting
and pricing decisions—but have met
opposition from platform owners.

New value propositions
In the digital era, traditional insurance
models are threatened by the availability
of reams of data, much of it real-time,
that help mitigate risk. One of the
biggest challenges on the horizon is the
development of autonomous vehicles
and advanced driver assistance systems
(ADAS). These technologies will put
passenger cars and other vehicles fully
or partially under computer control,
reducing premiums as driving becomes
safer, and ultimately shifting liability from
the driver to the car manufacturer or its
software vendor. ADAS systems, ranging
from adaptive cruise control to traffic
sign recognition, are already becoming
common on passenger cars (Exhibit 2).

Stefan Heck, CEO of Nauto, a US-based
start-up that provides autonomous vehicle
technology, believes that as a result, some
70 percent of loss events will disappear
in the course of ten years (see “Once in
four-generation change: An interview with
Stefan Heck of Nauto”).
The same shift toward risk prevention
exists in other business lines. Sensors in
the home and devices that monitor our
health reduce the likelihood of accidents
or sickness. Accordingly, insurers are
beginning to offer new services, often
in conjunction with partners, in the
ecosystems that are growing around new
data. “The big difference in insurance in
the future is going to be service,” says
Eldes Mattiuzzo, CEO of Youse Seguros,
the online insurance sales platform of
Brazilian carrier Caixa Seguradora.

“There isn’t one size
fits all. Depending
on our situation, we
will partner, we will
invest, we’ll build
ourselves. And that
gives us all ways to
plan.”

officer of Aviva

more—all of which can be instantly

Home insurers might become part of an
ecosystem centered on an app that helps
home buyers take out insurance, and also
values the property, predicts utility costs,
offers smart-home devices to monitor fire
or flood risks, sends storm alerts, and, if a
problem is detected while the homeowner
is away, offers to send out an inspector or
repair person.

To seize the opportunities and overcome
the threats implicit in digital disruption,
incumbents have no choice but to
innovate. Innovation must become a core
capability.
We see three ways for insurers to develop
new ideas and accelerate innovation:
by forming strategic partnerships, by
investing in start-ups that have digital
expertise, and by creating in-house

Liberty Mutual, for example, is
collaborating with Nest, a manufacturer
of smoke detectors and other connected
home products, to reduce homeowner
risk. The insurer provides Nest smoke
detectors to policyholders who agree to
let the company check every month via
wifi whether the batteries are working.
The homeowner gets discounted cover in
return. Linus Lundberg, head of enterprise
partnerships at Nest, foresees a wealth of
opportunities to build insurance products
around the many connected products that

are emerging—a “one-plus-one-is-three
proposition” is how he describes it. “There
are products that we can provide, and a
set of insurance products, so the value
goes beyond reacting when something
bad is happening, to helping customers
prevent it from happening in the first
place.”
In time, an auto insurer might be part
of an ecosystem that includes not
just telematics providers and car
manufacturers, but also roadside

expertise. They can use all three
approaches, but are likely to emphasize
one or another for strategic reasons.
Andrew Brem, Aviva’s chief digital officer,
explains it thus: “There are some things we
want to do ourselves from scratch, and we
have the capabilities, but sometimes we
take equity investments. There isn’t one
size fits all. Depending on our situation,
we will partner, we will invest, we’ll build
ourselves. And that gives us all ways to
plan.”

“We’ll see a dramatic
reduction in accidents
as real-time collision
warning and
increasing automation
come into vehicles—
by 70 or 80 percent in
the long term.”
— Stefan Heck, CEO of Nauto
Strategic partnerships
For most insurers it would be unrealistic
to pursue innovation entirely under their
own steam. Partnerships can help them
rapidly provide new types of policies or
ways of selling them, gain expertise, and
play in ecosystems beyond the insurance
industry (see “Partnerships, scale, and

36

The age of innovation

speed: The hallmarks of a successful IoT
strategy”).
Allianz, for example, has set up a joint
venture with Chinese internet giant Baidu
that enables it to use data on consumers’
online behavior to create customized
offers. If an individual orders a plane ticket,
for instance, the system will automatically
send an offer for flight insurance. This
not only gives Allianz a new way to sell
insurance, it also grants the company
access to the vast Chinese market, which
it had trouble cracking on its own. The
Baidu partnership will, says Allianz CEO
Oliver Bäte, enable the insurer to “jump the
S-curve” in China.
AIG, meanwhile, has formed strategic
partnerships with IBM and other
technology vendors to boost its expertise
in risk analytics and cybersecurity.
Insurers’ need for technology capabilities
is likely to be a prime reason for embarking
on partnerships.
Investing in start-ups
Whether through direct or venture
investment, carriers can buy into new
companies to learn more about emerging
technology and its applications. AIG,
for example, has invested in Human
Condition Safety, a provider of wearable
devices aimed at maintaining workplace
safety. Munich Re’s equipment insurance
subsidiary Hartford Steam Boiler (which
already uses drones for site inspections)
has invested in Augury, which uses
sensors and analytics to monitor heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning systems,
improving maintenance and helping to
prevent break-downs.

Some insurers are funding technology
incubators. Swiss Re, for instance,
has set up an insurtech accelerator in
Bangalore, India, to help start-ups develop
products and services. Technology under
development ranges from data analytics
for predicting health outcomes to artificial
intelligence for customer engagement.

  

Insurers not only learn about new
technologies from these investments, they
also gain exposure to more agile ways
of working. In other words, working with
start-ups helps older companies build a
digital culture. Caribou Honig, founding
partner of QED investors, which supports
high-growth, data-led businesses, believes
working with start-ups is essential to “be in
the game.”
In-house innovation factories

This is the age of digital disruption. Across
industries, insurgents with digitally
enabled business models are challenging
incumbents and their established business
models. The incumbents have a choice: be
disrupted or be the disruptors. Those that
prosper in the digital future will be those
that choose to be disruptors and invest in
innovation today.

Our view is that innovation is too important
to be outsourced entirely. Accordingly,
companies need to get very good at taking
ideas themselves and figuring out how to
commercialize them, roll them out on a
large scale, and integrate them with existing
processes, functions, and lines of business.
One way to improve in-house innovation
is to build dedicated labs. These units
are set up with a mandate to coordinate
the development of ideas and support
the scaling-up of the most promising
ones. AXA, MetLife, and Aviva have all
launched labs in Singapore, where the
government has backed the development
of an insurtech industry and companies
have access to the growing Asian market.
AXA is looking at innovation in data storage
and analysis, while MetLife’s LumenLab
focuses on innovations for healthy living.

There is plenty of talk about how digital
technology will affect consumers’ need
of insurance. The advent of autonomous
cars will reduce the requirement for auto
insurance, for example, while monitoring
by the Internet of Things will lead insurers
into businesses that help consumers
mitigate risk rather than simply protect
against it.

Capturing value from the core
Insurers’ existing customers, brands, data, and technical
skills are valuable business assets if they can be catapulted
into the digital age.

Without doubt, insurers must take a hard
look at what the future might hold and
strategize accordingly. But in the nearer
term, customers’ insurance needs will
change less radically than the ways in
which those needs can be met with digital
technology—and there is considerable
value to be had from a carrier digitizing
existing business as a result. We estimate,
for example, that a typical large auto
insurer could, over a five-year period, more
than double profitability by harnessing the
power of digital to attract and satisfy more
customers, while simultaneously cutting
operating costs and improving pricing
and underwriting accuracy. (See “Facing
digital reality” for further details of this
analysis.)
It is crucial such value is captured, as it
is only by digitizing the core that insurers
will be in a position to compete over the
long term, however the industry evolves.
Doing so will generate the funds for future
investment as well as build the skills and
capabilities that will be the hallmark of
successful carriers.
Capturing this shorter-term value is no
easy task. Existing customers, brands,

38

Capturing value from the core

data, and technical skills are valuable
business assets, but they need to be
catapulted into the digital age. That
will require the reinvention of the core
business and the rethinking of decadesold beliefs and practices, with more rigor
and determination than most insurers
have shown in the past. Simply hooking
digital assets—a digital sales channel or a
snazzy new service app—on to an analog
business model does not make a digital
business.

Existing customers,
brands, data, and
technical skills are
valuable business
assets, but they need
to be catapulted into
the digital age.
Instead, carriers need to digitally redesign
entire customer journeys—from the
moment a customer considers taking out
a new policy to the moment of purchase,
for example, or from the moment a
customer needs to make a claim to the
moment of reimbursement. That in turn
will require an integrated approach: the
digitization of customer-facing processes
and the seamless automation of back-end
ones.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

39

Redesigning customer journeys
Central to capturing value from the core
business is recognizing how digital can
drive a fundamental shift in the way
companies interact with customers. No
longer do customers have to contend
with what, from their perspective, are
slow and frustrating processes defined
by a carrier’s internal functional silos
and technical limitations. Instead,
digital technology and the redesign of
customer journeys can help them to
move quickly and seamlessly across
channels and touchpoints, and deliver
personalized communications. Indeed,
digitization in other industries has led
customers to expect nothing less than
this level of ease and convenience.
The redesign of a customer journey
model has three components. The first
is design thinking—putting customers
at the center of the business and
considering how best to meet their
needs and how they interact with
the business at each stage of each
journey they embark upon. The newly
designed journey is enabled by the
second component, automation and
analytics. These are used to anticipate
customer demands, shorten waiting
times, personalize experiences, and
automate simpler customer interactions
(a small auto claim, for example),
while significantly reducing costs and
complexity for carriers. A rapid launch of
the redesigned journey is then ensured
by the third component, agile working
methods, which are deployed across
the business, not just in IT. All these

40

Capturing value from the core

components need to be addressed to
improve the underlying value levers of
the insurer’s business model.

“We’ve changed from
knowing everything
upfront to trying
and testing. Where
we used to have
everything ready and
done before we put it
into action, now we
can put it into action
and learn on the way.”
— David Stachon, CEO
of German direct insurer
CosmosDirekt
The outcome is threefold: higher
customer satisfaction, greater efficiency,
and greater effectiveness. Our work
suggests that in a claims journey for auto
insurance, for example, digitization can
raise customer satisfaction by between
10 and 15 points, improve claims
adjustment expenses by as much as 30
percent, and increase the accuracy of
payments—by cutting down on fraud,
for example—by around 4 percentage

points. (Exhibit 1 explains what underpins
these figures.) In the past, trying to pull
off this hat trick seemed an impossible
task, but not today. As Oliver Bäte, CEO of
Allianz, said in a speech recently: “We can
meet customer expectations that were too
expensive in the past. We can customize
and individualize things and we can make
them more flexible. Flexibility used to be
the opposite of efficiency, and that is the
paradigm that is disappearing because
you can offer a very efficient solution at
very low cost.”
The fundamentals of a redesign
Before considering the process for
redesigning customer journeys,
companies need to take on board the
fundamental elements that support it:
customer empathy, the marriage of form
and function, an iterative approach, and
agile, cross-functional teams.
Customer empathy. Good design is based
on an understanding not only of what
customers say they want, but of what
might go unimagined if they are bound
by the present. Henry Ford put it like this:
“If I had asked people what they wanted,
they would have said faster horses.”
What they really wanted, of course, was
something that was not just faster but
more comfortable and capable too.
It is customer empathy that enables digital
companies to move beyond incremental,
me-too improvements to drive stepchanges in customer experiences—
perhaps mapping the progress of an
incoming tow truck to relieve customer

anxiety after a car accident. The success
of many new, digital insurance companies
lies not so much in the digital tools they
deploy but in the experience those tools
enable: a faster, more transparent, and
more intuitive approach to shopping for
and servicing insurance.
The marriage of form and function.
Good design must also marry form (the
customer experience) with function (the
value to the business). The design process
needs continually to check that both
are being met. Reducing time spent on
the phone for simple sales and service
transactions is an example of where
customer and business interests meet in a
marriage of form and function.

A typical large
auto insurer could
more than double
profitability over 5
years by harnessing
the power of digital.
An iterative approach. In a digital era,
capturing value demands an iterative,
speedy development of processes and
services to keep pace with changing
technology and customer expectations. It
is important that insurers feel comfortable
with the idea of testing products and

experiences with customers as they are
developed—rather than waiting until
they are complete—in order to obtain
immediate feedback and ensure the
solution delivered is the one customers
want. The aim is to bring a prototype,
known in venture capital and start-up
jargon as a “minimum viable product”
(MVP), to market in months rather than
years. The MVP is then refined in a series

of tests with users. It is easy to imagine
the Swiss army knife being developed in
this way—first the simple blade, then a
bottle opener, then scissors and file, and
eventually an entire suite of tools.
David Stachon, CEO of German direct
insurer CosmosDirekt, explains how
the test-and-learn approach speeds
progress. “We’ve changed from knowing

Digital distribution and claims in P&C
Lemonade, a New York-based start-up that offers insurance for renters, uses a
conversational chatbot powered by artificial intelligence to recreate the experience of
texting or messaging with an agent to deliver tailored sales recommendations, followed by
instantly issued policies. When a claim occurs, the same chatbot is used for first notice of
loss and damage assessment; in some cases it will issue payment in under three seconds.
Lemonade aims to use digital technology to improve the customer experience and keep its
expense ratio down, passing savings on to customers.

Digital distribution in individual life
Haven Life, a direct-to-consumer life insurer started by MassMutual, uses digital
technology to offer medically underwritten term life insurance quickly and at low cost. By
tapping into other data sources such as prescription history and motor vehicle records,
Haven can issue policies without asking customers to undergo unpleasant, lengthy, and
costly (for the carrier) medical tests. And by going directly to the consumer it eliminates the
distribution expenses associated with agents—often more than 100 percent of the first
year’s premium.

44

Capturing value from the core

everything upfront to trying and testing.
Where we used to have everything ready
and done before we put it into action, now
we can put it into action and learn on the
way. That’s a huge paradigm shift.” The
methodology also avoids costly mistakes,
as wrong moves can be quickly corrected
with early feedback. But insurers will need
to embrace failures in order to learn from
them, and recognize that the journey
is never really complete: it undergoes
constant iteration.
Agile, cross-functional teams. In a
rapidly changing environment, insurers’
various functions—risk, underwriting,
claims, marketing, and sales—offer deep
expertise but are often too rigidly siloed to
respond quickly. Moreover, in a functional
set-up, no one owns the full customer
experience. It can take several weeks
and many working sessions to create a
complete view of it, and still not everyone
will be committed to its improvement
given the various performance metrics
used. The solution is cross-functional
teams whose common goal is to remove
customer pain points and capture the
business opportunity.
Adopting an agile approach, these
teams work in “sprints” to meet specific,
agreed development targets week by
week, incorporate regular user feedback,
and hold daily meetings to ensure
progress is transparent and deadlines
are met. Regular review meetings
with other stakeholders from affected
business functions help identify areas
for enhancement. In this arrangement, IT

and the business work closely to splice
business and customer. IT’s role thus
becomes strategic—it is no longer a
support function. (See “IT moves center
stage” for more on this topic.)

The approach
These fundamentals are all reflected in
the redesign of a customer journey. There
are three stages in the redesign: define,
design, and deliver (Exhibit 2). The first
stage, define, is about understanding
what customers want and why, and how
the business will benefit from meeting
their expectations. For simple claims,
for example, customers might seek
assurance that their case is being fasttracked without their having to call the
adjustor to check progress; the adjustor
saves time as a result. These customer
needs are uncovered by mapping current
customer journeys and identifying
opportunities and pain points, an exercise
that can be achieved within three to five
weeks through ethnographic market
research and close customer contact. A
company might not choose to fix all the
opportunities and pain points identified,
but it does need to address the highest
priorities. This stage forms the foundation
of cross-functional collaboration that will
mark the new way of working.
Next comes the design phase. For the
time being, it ignores constraints such
as immature technology or regulatory
limitations and instead focuses exclusively
on the customer need and the business
objective (“maximum aspirational

example, the team might decide that a
lightweight chatbot based on artificial
intelligence is the best way to accelerate
customer response times. It would test
the concept with customers, refining it
several times, and then break it apart
into a set of discrete features. Each
is assessed for feasibility (business,
technical, and regulatory) in order to
prioritize those features that can be
developed immediately (the MVP). In this
case, instead of a chatbot, adjustors might

the charge for a new way of working, a
team of four to six full-stack developers,
experience and visual designers, and
representatives from relevant business
functions. Once released, often to a
limited set of end-users at first, customer
feedback is gathered. This, along
with confirmation that the underlying
technology is stable, is used to develop
version 2.0 almost immediately with the
next set of prioritized features.

Scaling up
Almost every customer- or agent-facing
touchpoint is part of a journey that could
be digitized to some degree to make
it more satisfying for customers, more
efficient, and more effective. Exhibit
3 describes a handful of journeys ripe
for redesign, with examples of how
the customer experience could be
transformed.

aggressive target would be to redesign
25 to 35 journeys within three years,
accelerating the pace of the roll-out during
that period as the redesign approach
improves with experience.
To support the roll-out, IT infrastructure
often needs upgrading to include modern
technology stacks, cloud architecture,
automated testing, reusable application
program interfaces (APIs), and a flexible
middle layer that links customer-facing
applications to underlying systems. New
hires and new partnerships will also be
required to build the necessary skills, and
different organizational structures will
have to be considered. Some companies
choose to set up a separate division to
lead digital initiatives, believing they need
the distance, space, and a degree of
autonomy from the old business in order
to flourish.
  

The question thus becomes, which
customer journeys should be tackled
first? The choice will differ by organization,
but it is important to prioritize journeys
that will demonstrate early impact and so
gather enthusiasm and support for more
investment.
Generally, the choice and sequencing are
guided by the value likely to be captured
and the feasibility: is the IT architecture
in place, and are there enough people
with the right capabilities? This will shape
the roadmap for the coming months. An

48

Capturing value from the core

As technology evolves, so will the extent to
which customer journeys are transformed
to include an array of products and
services. Home insurers, for example,
might become part of an ecosystem
centered on a mobile app that not only
helps home buyers take out insurance,
but also values the property, predicts
variable costs such as annual energy
charges, helps the homeowner catalog
possessions against any future claim,
offers smart-home devices to monitor fire
or flood risks, and, if a problem is detected

while the home owner is away, offers to
send out an inspector. The app could even
send alerts of pending storms, advise on
precautions that might be taken to protect
the home, and offer a snow removal or
repair service once the danger passes.
Redesigning customer journeys is not
therefore simply a way of creating value
from insurers’ core business today. It
also prepares them for the future. The
cost savings the process delivers will
be essential if insurers are to compete
with low-cost digital attackers and invest
in innovative products and services.
Just as importantly, it equips today’s
insurers with the means to adapt swiftly
and continuously to changing customer
needs—whatever the shape of tomorrow’s
insurance industry.

Insurers have always offered “virtual”
products and based their success on a
data-driven business model. Information
technology has thus been essential to
their operations. Yet the industry has been
slow to adopt digital technology and, in
particular, to grasp the benefits arising
from the Internet of Things (IoT). If it is to
do so, it needs to put its foot firmly on the
accelerator.
The soaring number of internet-connected
devices that constitutes the IoT signals
their influence. In 2010, there were 12.4

be more than 50 billion. These devices,
equipped with sensors and activators
and attached to all manner of objects or
worn by people, can convey vast amounts
of data back to companies in real time
and enable virtually immediate analysis
and response, often without the need for
human intervention. The way companies
in many industries operate is changing
because of them.

In the energy industry, for example, the
IoT is being applied to the maintenance of
wind turbines to improve their repair speed
and reliability. In agriculture, sensors that
monitor soil humidity and trigger irrigation
are raising productivity. For insurers too,
the IoT presents an array of opportunities,
particularly in relation to the way they
interact with customers—but it also poses
a threat to existing business models. A
winning IoT strategy will depend upon the
partnerships and scale insurers can build,
and the speed at which they do so.

The emergence of ecosystems
At present, there are four primary areas
for insurers considering an IoT strategy:
connected cars,1 connected health,
connected homes, and IoT in commercial
lines. The IoT can enhance existing
business models in each and allow for
more accurate risk assessment. For
example, auto insurers used to price

policies on the basis of proxy variables
such as the age, residence, and credit
score of a driver. Today, they can price
on the basis of real usage and driving
behavior, such as how fast a vehicle
is being driven and whether it is being
driven at night. In a commercial setting,
insurers can now know whether a
business owner is following required
safety and maintenance procedures.

While offering
plenty of potential
to enhance the
business model,
connected devices
also challenge it.
On top of the core business of offering
insurance policies, connected devices
also give insurers the opportunity to
interact more often with their customers
and to offer new services on the basis
of data collected—a step change in an
industry where customer relationships
are often delegated to an agent or
broker, and customer touchpoints tend
to be limited to annual renewals and
occasional claims.
While offering plenty of potential to
enhance the business model, however,
connected devices also challenge it.
The auto industry—the most mature
sector in terms of its adoption of
connected devices—illustrates the

52

point. Cars are increasingly equipped
with sensors that, besides monitoring
a driver’s behavior and vehicle usage,
can collect other vehicle data such as
oil temperature, brake wear, and tire
pressure. A host of new applications
are thus enabled that meet customer
demands for convenience, safety,
and security. And as their number
grows, an ecosystem forms around the
connected car, involving automakers,
telecom companies, sensor and chip
manufacturers, digital platform giants
such as Uber, academic institutions
and standards-making bodies, and, of
course, insurers.
The emergence of this connected-car
ecosystem changes the competitive
landscape for all participants, but
particularly for insurers. Connected cars
have fewer accidents and breakdowns—
the new technology increasingly
prevents them. Hence, premiums
fall. This downtick is potentially
aggravated by significant changes in
risk distribution. Connected devices can
separate out the high-risk customers
from the lower-risk ones, so the insurer’s
focus moves to predicting and managing
individual risks rather than communities
of risk and to developing new actuarial
models. Moreover, careful drivers might
expect significant discounts on their
insurance premiums that will be difficult
to balance with price increases for
higher-risk drivers. These developments
are expected to put pressure on hitherto
stable revenue streams.
The loss of these risk-based revenues
could well be offset by the emergence of

Partnerships, scale, and speed: The hallmarks of a successful IoT strategy

new, service-based revenues, however.
Insurers could offer risk-prevention
services, alerting drivers that their car
needs a service, for example, or finding
smart parking solutions. They could
even offer proprietary data and analytics
solutions to third parties, such as media
agencies that focus on location-based
advertisements.
Yet, notwithstanding assets such as
proprietary data, long-established
customer relationships, and analytical
capabilities, insurers might not be in the
best position to tap the IoT. To access
the valuable data from sensors upon
which new, hybrid insurance models
depend, they will probably have to enter
partnerships with the companies that own
the data, such as auto manufacturers and
health equipment producers—and these
companies might have better contacts
with their customers than insurers do.
In that case, auto manufacturers that
fit monitoring devices to every car as
standard, or telecom companies that
upgrade buildings with smart home
sensors, could become gatekeepers
to insurance customers. At the same
time, companies outside the insurance
industry are building risk-related data and
analytics, alongside service capabilities.
In other words, the IoT could undermine
insurers’ two hitherto critical competitive
advantages—their underwriting skills and
their customer access.

Becoming an attractive partner
What will it take for insurers to succeed in a
connected world? Carriers should start by
asking themselves three questions. Can I

find the right partner? Can I build enough
scale? And can I move quickly enough?
The question of finding the right partner is
closely related to the question of building
sufficient scale. Any partner will be need
to be sizeable. That is because very large
amounts of sensor data will be required,
on top of the proprietary data insurers
already have, if meaningful insights are
to be extracted from it, especially to
get to sufficiently long claims histories
in order to assess risks. At present, in
respect of connected cars, for example,
many sensor systems are of limited value
because they have neither sufficient
geographic coverage nor a link to data on
actual claims frequency or severity.

Insurers need to make
themselves attractive
potential partners.
Insurers can enhance their chances of
finding the right partner by considering
carefully how they position themselves
within an IoT ecosystem. For example,
consumers are increasingly suspicious
of companies collecting their data; thus
insurers can present themselves as
trusted and reliable collaborators. They
can also highlight their capabilities in risk
assessment. Yet ultimately, the most
attractive insurers in the ecosystem will
be those keen to build risk mitigation
capabilities too, and to help provide
services such as roadside assistance and
medical assistance.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

53

This leads to the third question: can I move
quickly enough? Before long, the IoT will
reach a tipping point where insurers not
yet in the game could find themselves
locked out. Unless they move fast, they
might find it hard to secure a partner with
the necessary mass of data and customer
access. An auto manufacturer might
need only one insurance partner, after all.
Similarly, in the connected home market,
those with the data are likely to be picky.
In the end, this could be a winner-takesall situation in which first movers shape
the market and sustain a competitive
advantage.

Rao is a digital vice president in the

The authors would like to thank Simon
Behm and Thomas Schumacher for their
contributions to this article.

Insurers therefore need to make
themselves attractive potential partners.
That means defining a compelling value
proposition and building the critical
capabilities: next-generation IT that can
interact with multiple external systems,
advanced analytics that connect an
insurer’s data with insights from partners
in the various ecosystems, the ability to
integrate coverage and service solutions,
and digitally native talent experienced
in agile and test-and-learn modes of
working.
The inevitable uncertainty that still
surrounds the development of the IoT
should not prevent insurers from taking
bold, urgent action. The fast lane is the
place to be.

Modernizing IT for a strategic role
IT has long been seen as a cost of doing business
by insurance companies. In a digital era, it must be
modernized and recast as a strategic one.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

55

Insurers’ success has always depended
upon their ability to analyze data, and
thus to price and underwrite policies
accurately. The purpose of IT has been
to support these capabilities and as such
it has been regarded as a cost of doing
business. In a digital environment, this
relationship and attitude have to change.
While the successful insurers of the future
will still excel at the analysis of large data
pools, their IT functions will move toward
playing a strategic role. In the words of
Danny Dagher, group chief information
officer of regional universal banking group
Bank Audi, “There are many insurance
companies that run IT as a support
function. [In today’s environment,] that will
kill them.”

With so much realtime data being
generated in a
connected world,
digital technology
is pushing insurers
toward new types
of business that
help consumers
mitigate risk rather
than simply protect
against it.

56

Modernizing IT for a strategic role

The reason is that technology is defining
the winning business model in insurance,
as in other industries. It has set a high
bar for service—with customers now
expecting simplicity, speed, transparency,
and customization—while reducing the
cost of that service. At the same time, with
so much real-time data being generated
in a connected world, digital technology
is pushing insurers toward new types of
business that help consumers mitigate
risk rather than simply protect against it.
If IT is to sit at the center of a new business
model, insurers will need to make two
commitments. First, they will have to
invest heavily to build IT capabilities and
modernize core platforms. For some
incumbents, that might mean as much
as 10 percent of a single year’s premiums
spread over a five-year period, depending
on the starting point and the extent of
the modernization needed. That level
of spending might be hard for some to
contemplate, not least because premiums
are destined to fall as a result of digital
technology (see “Facing digital reality”).
But they should bear in mind that wise
investments to upgrade IT can ultimately
lower their IT and operating costs relative
to those of their peers and bring efficiency
in IT to the level required in today’s market
(Exhibit 1).
Second, insurers will need to commit
to new ways of working. That means
a differentiated approach to IT
development, and a more collaborative
IT operating model that changes not only
the way business leaders work with IT,

but also how they think about IT. Without
this change, large investments could be
wasted.
An understanding of what IT needs to
deliver in a digital age reveals why these
commitments are so important.

The deliverables
There are four elements of a highperforming digital insurance business
(Exhibit 2).
A digital portfolio of products and
services within an ecosystem of partners

The products and services that digital
technology enables constantly evolve. A
leading-edge portfolio already includes
features such as dynamic pricing,
whereby prices are instantly adjusted
based on predictions relating to claims or
client churn, for example, and real-time
customization of products from a set of
both mandatory and optional product
modules, again allowing for dynamic
pricing.
New types of product will emerge as
digital technology alters the nature of the
industry. Access to ever more real-time
data, particularly via the Internet of Things,

A large European insurer has modularized its auto insurance to enable customers to
tailor policies to their needs—either by choosing one of three pre-defined packages or
by assembling a policy from a range of modules including roadside assistance, rental car
guarantee, and compensation for loss in value. Because the dozen or so modules are
standardized and individually priced, the straight-through processing (STP) rate for the
issuance of policies is close to 100 percent, delivering considerable cost savings, while the
average new-business premium per contract has risen by 6 percent.

means more accurate assessment of
risk, but also less risk. Sensors in the
home can warn of the danger of fire,
sensors in the car can help prevent
accidents, and sensors worn on the
body can alert physicians to health
problems. In addition, the data gives rise
to new services that can be combined
with insurance products—a medical

check-up, or an automatically triggered
appointment for repairs when a fault is
detected on a car.
Importantly, in a connected world,
insurers will need to complement
their proprietary data with data from
other industries and external sources.
For example, car manufacturers will

arguably have more insight into a driver’s
risk than insurers do once sensors
become fitted to vehicles as standard.
Insurers will therefore no longer be able
to rely solely on their underwriting skills,
but will need to partner with companies
from other industries, such as auto
manufacturers and telecoms operators,
to become part of the ecosystem forming
around the data stream, offering products
and services of which insurance is but one
component (see “Partnerships, scale, and
speed: The hallmarks of a successful IoT
strategy”).

required to implement them either in the
product system or other core systems.
IT will also need to manage quite
different relationships. Under the
traditional insurance model there was
clear differentiation between a carrier’s
customers and suppliers. But that line
is blurring as insurers increasingly offer
value-added services that are provided by
external partners, in addition to traditional
insurance products, and an ecosystem of
partners takes shape.

A Dutch insurer has partnered with a leading technology company to develop an internet
platform for the remote monitoring of chronically ill patients, aimed at containing costs and
increasing customer satisfaction by encouraging healthier lifestyles. In a similar effort, South
African insurer Discovery has developed the Vitality platform, now available globally through
partnerships—with John Hancock in the United States and AIA in Singapore and Australia,
for example. It encourages its more than 5.5 million members to lead healthier lifestyles, and
in return offers discounts on a range of products and services.

Modernizing IT for a strategic role

Increased sales and retention through
an optimized channel mix

IT capabilities clearly contribute to the
value of such digital portfolios. Technically,
product systems need to be flexible
in order to map modularized product
structures, for example, and must lend
themselves to being integrated, alongside
other systems in the IT landscape, with
those of external partners to enable
joint development, testing, and release.
Organizationally, IT needs to support the
business to bring new products to the
market within weeks rather than months,
and with little or no additional IT effort

An omnichannel customer experience
Whatever products and services an
insurer offers, customers want to
access them across a range of channels
where they enjoy the same high-quality
experience that they are used to from
other industries, such as retail. And
they want to be able to switch from one
to another without the disruption of
having to repeat themselves or re-enter
data. Companies that fail to provide
this omnichannel experience will lose
customers to competitors that do.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

59

Advanced analytics
A US insurer has launched a mobile app that enables customers to get an instant quotation
for auto insurance by taking a snapshot of their driver’s license, to report vehicle damage by
sending photos, and to find a service center for repairs. Claims processing time has fallen
by up to 20 percent as a result. A European insurer has launched a similar app for mobile
quotations and underwriting; cycle times for policy issuance have fallen from three weeks
to three minutes.

The implications for insurers are clear.
They need round-the-clock platforms for
all channels, with functionalities available
to customers, sales partners, and
external partners on multiple devices
and user front-ends. They need to equip
the salaried salesforce and tied agents
with mobile devices and applications
that ease the sales process with existing
and potential customers. And they
need to provide those customers with
self-service tools that enable them to
acquire real-time quotations, make
administrative alterations to policies
(such as changing an address or direct
debit information), or notify a claim.
Automated operations
The automation of processes increases
customer satisfaction while reducing
operating costs, and touches every step

in the value chain regardless of the line
of business or channel. The generation
of sales leads and the processing of
high-frequency, low-cost claims are
just two candidates ripe for automation.
Increasingly, however, insurers will need
not only to automate basic processes
further, but also to deploy robotics with
artificial intelligence and advanced
analytics to make better decisions,
faster.
Achieving a high degree of automation
requires profound changes to IT
architecture because every layer
is affected. For example, policy
administration and claims systems will
need to be overhauled, be it in response
to a higher overall level of IT intensity, the
introduction of novel robotics and script
systems, or upgraded workflow engines.

A Scandinavian insurer has rigorously automated the claims handling process. For first
notice of loss, it deploys “smart” scripts to capture the fields relevant for STP; in claims
handling it checks coverages through a rules engine and calculates costs upfront through
a data-based inspection system. In these ways, the insurer has been able to achieve STP
rates in claims of up to 30 percent in auto insurance and 60 percent in health.

60

Modernizing IT for a strategic role

Insurers increasingly employ advanced
analytics to help them make better
decisions. Some auto insurers, for
example, use credit scores to assess
risk more accurately, as analytics have
revealed that people who pay their bills on
time tend to be safer drivers. And some
life insurers are using social network and
geographical data to reduce fraud by up to
25 percent. Ultimately, advanced analytics
will become a capability that sits at the
core of the way business is conducted
across the value chain, further driving the
level of automation.

value-creating insights via predictive
models or machine learning.

A strategy for building nextgeneration IT
Delivering on all this is replete with
challenges. There is the technical
challenge of overcoming the drag of
legacy systems and the practical one of
hiring new talent—both of which may be
familiar to some insurers. Yet if the full
strategic value of IT is to be realized, new,
often unfamiliar ways of working and
thinking will be required too.

A large European insurance group has developed a statistical model to predict and reduce
customer churn. By analyzing variables such as the price paid for a policy, the percentage
price increase year on year, and how long the policy has been held, it can identify those
customers most likely to leave. It then reverse-engineers competitors’ prices and optimizes
its own prices accordingly. In addition, having identified those clients most at risk of leaving,
it is able to concentrate agents’ efforts on retaining them. As a result, renewal rates have
increased by up to 7 percentage points and bottom-line profits by as much as 5 percent.

Capturing the technology’s potential
hinges on the ability to administer and
analyze data (whether from internal
or external sources) in a consistent
manner across all channels. Both will
require significant changes to existing IT
architectures. These include establishing
a master data-management system that
gives a consolidated view of all data, in
particular customer and product data, and
the deployment of big data and advanced
analytics systems that integrate data
sources and provide platforms to generate

We see four key components of a strategy
to modernize IT for the digital age.
Systematic building of new capabilities
With most incumbent insurers, there is a
gap between the capabilities they have
and the capabilities they need. A clear plan
is required to bridge the gap, based on a
grasp of the present state and the target
state over the next three to five years.
Areas must be prioritized and initiatives
agreed.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

61

Beyond exceptional general capabilities
such as fast decision-making, the ability
to learn and react, and strong central
steering, the essential qualities needed to
keep pace with digital leaders are rigorous
discipline in IT execution, world-class
agile IT engineering, a scalable cloud
infrastructure, and a single, open, and
flexible application architecture.

“Think of all the
informational assets
you have as an
insurer ... if that’s all
hard coded, and if it
takes massive capital
expense and effort in
order to make even
superficial changes
to that environment,
then you are, in a
sense, suffering from
strategic lock in.”
—Marcus Ryu, CEO of
Guidewire
Fresh talent will be required to strengthen
existing capabilities and build new ones.
Traditional methods of recruiting via
agencies, job listings, or internal referrals

62

Modernizing IT for a strategic role

might have to be augmented by searches
among developer communities, via
participation in technology conferences
and other events, or by establishing
partnerships with software providers. In
turn, developers will expect prospective
employers to check their contributions
to open code communities, not rely on
interviews.
A differentiated approach to IT
development
Digital attackers can build their IT
capabilities from scratch, aiming precisely
at specific emerging opportunities.
Incumbents have the advantage of large
policyholder books of business, but are
burdened by system environments which
were designed for traditional operating
models and are challenging to adapt
to contemporary digital preferences.
Marcus Ryu, the CEO of Guidewire, a
US software provider for P&C insurers,
describes the situation as “strategic
lock-in.”
That said, these legacy assets still have
considerable value, which needs to
be maximized. Often, the solution is a
bimodal approach comprising “digital IT”
and “foundational IT.” In respect of the
first, the innovative features and products
demanded by customers are released
quickly by replacing the waterfall method
of software development—whereby
software is developed, tested, and
deployed in a strict sequence—with agile
methods whereby teams work in sprints
to meet weekly development targets.
Features are tested with customers and
refined and refreshed in rapid iterations.
Meanwhile, the development and

management of foundational IT—the
parts that support business capabilities
requiring less agility and speed—can
be approached in a traditional, more
structured manner to ensure the stability
and reliability of systems, and cost
efficiency. Our experience is that the
division of digital IT and foundational
IT should be made according to
business capabilities and where speed
will differentiate a company. Hence
customer portals, social management,
and customer relationship management
typically belong to digital IT, while risk
management, fraud management, and
accounting belong to foundational IT with
longer release cycles.
Some believe the bimodal approach
has drawbacks, arguing that agile ways
of working should be introduced as
broadly as possible. Our view is that
insurers should indeed switch to an agile
development approach wherever they
can, but the fact remains that releases in
foundational IT domains do not need to be
as frequent as those in digital IT domains.
A bimodal approach is therefore an
effective way to ensure that investments to
accelerate IT delivery are directed where
they will be most valuable.
That said, establishing a bimodal
approach requires time, careful
consideration, and commitment because
it involves radically evolving IT, an agile
collaboration culture (see below),
modern engineering methods such as
DevOps, increased use of services and
microservices, improvements to the
organizational set-up, and the honing
of talent.

“Moving toward an
agile methodology ...
means development
times are shorter.
And it includes—this
is the important
part—getting the
business people
involved in the
development of any
new solution.”
—Tom King, senior director
at US software company
Pegasystems
Modernized core platforms
For many incumbent insurers, there
is no getting away from the need to
overhaul their core platforms. Written
using decades-old, common businessoriented language (COBOL) or PL/I,
these monolithic, batch-processing
systems usually cannot deliver the speed,
agility, and flexibility required by a digital
business. They can present difficulties in
terms of operations and scalability, and
are too costly.
These insurers are left with three choices:
build a new core insurance platform
themselves, refactor the existing one

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

63

(by modernizing code or streamlining
the system architecture, for example),
or replace it with standard software.
The choice will depend on a range of
considerations, including the state of the
legacy systems, the level of ambition, and
the level of resources. Those wanting
to lead in processes and product
innovation, and able to invest accordingly,
might choose a proprietary platform.
This was the choice made by a global
insurance group seeking a platform
with a common core and country- and
entity-specific customizations in order
to promote common practices globally
while maintaining local flexibility. Insurers
with relatively stable and modern systems
that need to be able to support digital
technology might choose to refactor.
And those aiming for lean, standardized
processes and products might find
standard software to be the right solution.
A Benelux insurer that found itself with a
very expensive legacy system unsuited
to digital modification, and wishing to
institute lean processes, chose standard
software as its best option.
A collaborative IT operating model
The digital operating model is defined
by agile ways of working and by
collaboration—internally across the
business and externally with partners and
vendors.
Internally, a digital-ready operating model
is one in which IT works closely with all
other parts of the business. Yet most
insurers still organize themselves around
functions such as risk, underwriting,
claims, marketing, and sales. While these

64

Modernizing IT for a strategic role

functions have deep expertise, they are
too rigid to respond to rapid change.
Moreover, in a functional set-up, no one
really understands the entire customer
experience.

For many incumbent
insurers, there is no
getting away from
the need to overhaul
their core platforms.
Cross-functional teams organized
around products solve this problem.
Their combined expertise means they are
able to deliver the products and services
customers want and at the pace required
in a digital world, particularly if team
members are located in the same place
(often digital “garages” or “factories”),
they are empowered to make their own
decisions, and the entire team (not just
the IT people) adopts an agile approach to
its work. Flexible funding—replacing the
conventional one-off, annual budgeting
process—ensures that investment is
directed incrementally at projects that
show most promise.

might be needed too. If agile models
are to succeed, vendors might need to
work differently, in closer cooperation
with insurers. Insurers are therefore likely
to have to consolidate the number of
vendors with which they work. In addition,
contracts that fix prices, scope, and
budget might need to be replaced with
contracts that reward success.
This type of operating model requires
cultural change within IT and the
businesses. Leaders in both need to
help build an understanding across
the organization of how IT can define a
product’s value to customers, and how
agile ways of working can deliver that
value. This is particularly true for intangible
insurance products.

and culture. While near-term benefits can
be captured within six to 12 months, a
wholesale upgrade to the next generation
of IT capabilities can take as long as five
years and will require a company’s full
commitment and significant investment.
The effort will bring a reward beyond lower
overall unit costs: an IT function equipped
to play the strategic role crucial to an
insurer’s success in a digital world.

Working in cross-functional teams will

potential to enhance insurers’ current

it as a machine for building trust.2 In

arguably its most famous application,
it tracks transactions and facilitates
money transfer, while preventing doublespending, without the need for a bank.
But blockchain lends itself to many other
systems for keeping static records (of
land titles, for example), for registering
dynamically the exchange of assets,
and for making payments such as ticket
purchases. It is also a platform for “smart
contracts”—computer programs that
automatically initiate certain actions when
predefined conditions are met.

How it works
While blockchain technology can be used
in different ways, a blockchain solution
generally builds on four features.

The insurance industry in general,
however, lags behind other industries,
such as banking, in terms of the interest it
has so far expressed. It will have to catch

Decentralized validation. When a
transaction such as a ticket sale occurs,
new data blocks describing it are added
to a chain only after consensus is reached
among the relevant participants on the
validity of the action—for example, when

Redundancy. The blockchain is
continuously replicated on all or at least
a group of nodes in a network. As a
result, no single point of failure exists.

with data they would have to alter not

The promise of blockchain

With these characteristics, blockchain
can help address some of the key
challenges that many incumbent
insurers face in a digital age, including
the need to understand and meet
customer needs more fully and to cut
costs by making operations more
efficient. There follow some examples of
the way blockchain might be applied.
Meeting customer needs
In a digital world, winning companies
meet exacting consumer needs—for
tailored products, simplicity, and
transparency, for example. Insurers
traditionally have had little opportunity
to understand such needs, interaction
with customers being limited to buying
a policy or making a claim, processes
that might anyway be delegated to
brokers and agents. This explains both
the threat and often the success of
digital attackers that make customer
satisfaction their priority.
Blockchain can help insurers in this
both by sparing clients the frustration
of repeatedly having to provide data
for verification purposes—a copy of a
passport, for example—and by reducing
privacy concerns. No longer will it be
possible to pass that data on to a third
party without the client’s permission.
For instance, UK start-up Tradle is
working on a blockchain solution that will
enable financial institutions to conduct
the know-your-customer (KYC) checks

required by regulators to prevent money
laundering—a process that is otherwise
expensive and time-consuming for
institutions and annoying for clients if they
have to offer up the same information
about their identity and source of wealth
to different institutions. Once KYC data is
verified, the customer can use a private
key to grant companies in the network
access to the encrypted data whenever it
is needed.

process of verifying the delay can be a lot
of effort for relatively little reward.)

In addition, blockchain provides greater
transparency and hence perceived
fairness in respect of tariffs and claims
handling. Another UK start-up, InsurETH,
is working on a peer-to-peer flight

insurance policy built on blockchain with
smart contracts. The contracts initiate
payouts to the holders of insured tickets
when cancellations or delays are reported
from verified flight data sources, making
the claims and payments process quick
and easy. (Although many travelers could
claim compensation for flight delays under
their usual insurance, few do so as the

Similarly, smart contracts could trigger
the claims and payments processes for
damage caused in the home or to a car
and detected and verified by sensors
linked to the Internet of Things, doing
away with quibbling about the causes
of damage and phone calls to chase the
progress of a claim.

An estimated 5 to 10 percent of all
insurance claims are fraudulent, costing
US non-health insurers more than $40
billion a year according to the FBI. By
serving as a cross-industry, distributed
registry of external and customer data,
blockchain can be used to identify fraud.
It can, for example, expose falsified
damage or theft reports by validating the
authenticity, ownership, and provenance
of goods, authenticating documents such
as medical reports, checking police theft
reports and claims histories, and verifying
identities.
It is clear that extensive cooperation
between insurers, manufacturers,
customers, and other parties will be
needed to unlock Blockchain’s full
potential. Blockverify, a UK start-up, is
building a system that will enable users
to check for fraudulent transactions,
counterfeiting, or theft relating to
goods such as personal electronics,
pharmaceuticals, and luxury items. It
works by labeling products and then
storing their history and supply chain

activity in a blockchain. Everledger,
also based in the United Kingdom, has
devised a similar application, used to verify
diamonds and transactions relating to
them, and targeted at helping insurers, law
enforcers, and those in the diamond trade
to detect fraud.
Efficiency
Underlying many of these use cases is
another clear opportunity for insurers—to
reduce operational and administrative
costs. Automated verification of
policyholders’ identity and contract
validity, the auditable registration of
claims and data from third parties such
as doctors, the underwriting of smart
contracts, and the automation of claims
procedures all reduce costs while
speeding up processes.
The lower handling costs of a smart
contract could feasibly help open up new
growth markets. In emerging markets,
blockchain and smart contracts could be
used to offer micro-insurance to farmers,
for example, triggering payments to them
when drought conditions are verified by
a reliable meteorological source. And
insurers could potentially save the many
millions currently spent chasing down
fraud.

The way ahead
Blockchain clearly facilitates innovative
business models and promises cost
advantages to insurance companies and
their customers. Various barriers impede
its widespread adoption, however.
Scalability is the first challenge. The
technology’s consensus-based

70

The promise of blockchain

validation mechanism, its continuous
replication, and the ever-growing amount
of stored data means that the larger the
blockchain grows, the greater become the
requirements for storage, bandwidth, and
computational power. That leads to a risk
of centralization if the blockchain becomes
so large that only a few nodes are able to
process a block.

The lower handling
costs of a smart
contract could feasibly
help open up new
growth markets.
Second, recent incidents have shown
that for all blockchain’s security attributes,
it is not impregnable. For example,
hackers stole $65 million from Bitfinex,
a cryptocurrency exchange. Such
threats are not as well understood as
those related to conventional database
architectures.
Standardization is a third challenge. To
realize sustainable benefits from an open
or partially shared and distributed system,
some standardization will be necessary.
The current absence of industry
standards—which the B3i project is
seeking to address—reflects the newness
of the technology. A distributed system
that sometimes depends on collaboration
between competitors, suppliers, and
others will take time to evolve. So will
the resolution of legal and regulatory
issues. Thus there is a high risk of initiating

inefficient solutions, and investment
decisions will need to be taken carefully.
But the obstacles should not deter
insurers given that new companies are
rapidly embracing the technology and its
cost advantages. At their core, insurance
companies collect premiums, pool the
money, and reassign it to those with a
valid claim. Blockchain means all this can
now be automated and today’s insurers
potentially disintermediated—by the likes
of InsurETH, for example, or Dynamis,
a start-up that is using smart contracts
to offer peer-to-peer supplementary
unemployment insurance. In the latter
case, it is other policyholders on the
network who validate both the application
for insurance and the claim, using social
media.

involved in a transaction then insurers’
current transaction models are likely
to suffice. Moreover, it is unlikely to be
beneficial if no intermediary is needed,
or a trusted one already exists. But in
transactions involving multiple parties,
perhaps with competing incentives, where
an iron-clad record of data is needed, and
no central trusted authority is available
or needed—then blockchain technology
holds out huge promise, which insurers
would be wise to explore.

Matt Higginson is a partner in
McKinsey’s New York office, JohannesTobias Lorenz is a senior partner in the
Düsseldorf office, Peter Braad Olesen is
an associate partner in the Copenhagen
office, and Björn Münstermann is a
partner in the Munich office.

These examples pose no immediate great
threat to incumbents’ business. But they
should alert incumbents to blockchain’s
disruptive potential, and to the need
for them to help shape the blockchain
insurance ecosystem. The starting point
is to develop a thorough understanding
of how the technology can address
customers’ needs as well as their own,
and to identify potential applications.
That will mean working with consortia,
technology experts and start-ups,
regulators, and other market participants
to address the challenges. Incumbents
can learn from the start-ups and might
consider partnering with or acquiring
companies that are entering the insurance
market with blockchain-based products
and processes.
For the time being, it is important to bear
in mind what blockchain can and cannot
facilitate. If a limited number of parties are

The use of data and analytics to
underwrite risk is nothing new for
insurance carriers. Yet in a digital world,
it is revolutionizing their business.
An industry in which 80 percent of all
auto insurance claims are adjudicated
automatically, and 80 percent of all life
insurance policies are issued straight
through without requiring any of the
usual health checks, is no distant pipe
dream. Neither is one in which the cost
of acquiring a customer falls by as much
as 70 percent because of precision
marketing and personalization. Such is the
power of analytics.

The advance of analytics
Harnessing the potential of burgeoning data and
computer power to add value must become ingrained in
insurers’ every activity.

72

The advance of analytics

The convergence of several technology
trends is behind this revolution. The
volume of data continues to double
every three years as information pours
in from digital platforms, wireless
sensors, virtual reality applications, and
billions of mobile phones. Data storage
capacity has increased, while its cost
has plummeted. And data scientists now
have unprecedented computing power
at their disposal, giving birth to ever more
sophisticated algorithms. As a result
machine and deep learning are on the
horizon (see box, “Analyzing analytics”).
“We’re moving from computer science,
where computer coders write very explicit,
line-by-line instructions, toward starting to
train machines to look for information that
could be valuable,” says Scott Simony,
head of industry at Google.
Yet data and technology alone do not
deliver value, as too many companies
have discovered to their cost. While some
are seeing good results, others admit they

have seen little effect to date from their
investments in analytics.1

It is important that this changes quickly,
as those slow to adopt the technology at
scale will surely struggle to compete. They
will struggle against other insurers that use
analytics to improve their core business
by streamlining internal processes, raising
revenue and cutting costs in the process.
And they will struggle in the longer term
as data and its analysis begin to break
down business models and industry
boundaries. In personal auto insurance,
we can already see how data from sensors
fitted to vehicles will put premiums under
pressure as driving becomes safer. And

The advance of analytics

Here then, is how companies can move
quickly to build their analytics muscle
across the organization, avoiding
common problems and ensuring their
investments translate into business value.
There are four phases.

Phase one: Building insights
The starting point is to be clear about how
analytics can deliver insights and add
value, and choose the use cases that will
demonstrate this. Too often, companies
give scant thought to the business
problem they are trying to solve, instead
getting carried away with refining data,
gleaning perfect insights, or investing
heavily in technology infrastructure. The
exhibit shows how analytics can be put to
work in claims management.
It is also important to understand what
analytics can and cannot do. It cannot, for
example, predict outcomes with pinpoint
accuracy, particularly in low-frequency,
high-severity, or shock-prone lines of
business. For instance, the market for
directors and officers liability insurance
endured waves of litigation over the past
decade—and subsequent spikes in
claims—resulting from events such as
the financial crisis and new regulations
governing options backdating. It would
have been difficult to predict any of these
events with analytics.

Some life insurers
are using social
network and
geographical data to
reduce fraud by up
to 25 percent.
But their use can significantly improve
predictive capabilities, unearthing insights
upon which carriers can act. Some auto
insurers now use credit scores to assess
risk more accurately, analytics having
revealed that people who pay their bills
on time tend to be safer drivers. Some
life insurers are using social network and
geographical data to reduce fraud by up
to 25 percent. And some companies are
using data on insurance agents—their
behavior, previous sales, regional location,
and training undertaken—to predict how
likely each one is to sell multiple products,
and which specific products they would
be most successful at selling, leading to
a 20 to 25 percent increase in sales. As
machine learning technology develops,
it will be applied not only to predicting
events and forecasting outcomes, but
also to classification (including identifying
images or making associations between
data) and generation (from interpolating
missing data to generating the next frame
in a video sequence, for example).
Mining internal and external data
In some cases, organizations struggle to
develop convincing use cases because
data quality is poor. Many cannot yet

master their internal data, which remains
disaggregated, unstructured, and
generally underused, requiring substantial
effort to be brought into working condition.

changes to IT architectures are likely to
be required. These include establishing
a master data-management system that
gives a consolidated view of all data, in
particular customer and product data, and
the deployment of big data and analytics
systems that integrate data sources and
provide platforms to generate valuecreating insights via predictive models or
machine learning.

Phase 2: Capturing value
Here the focus shifts from proof of
concept to adoption, the goal being for the
businesses to lead demand for analytics.
That is unlikely to happen unless the
front line is involved from the outset and
performance measurements are chosen
carefully.
Involving the front line

Accomplishing this should perhaps be a
priority before a company begins mining
external data. An additional challenge
is to collect, integrate, and analyze
unstructured data such as web content,
network data, images, text, and audio and
video recordings.
Many incumbents struggle with switching
from legacy data systems to a nimbler
and more flexible architecture to store and
harness big data (whether from internal
or external sources). But capturing the
potential of analytics hinges on it. At the
outset, companies should bear in mind
the business case they are making,
and that the very latest technology and
significant upfront investment are not
always needed. Before long, though,

76

The advance of analytics

When companies falter in their use of
analytics it is often because the old way of
working still prevails: that is, build a model
(often based on unclear assumptions
about the variables that have most
predictive impact on the outcome) and
roll it out, regardless of whether people on
the front line understand precisely how to
apply it. They might not know, for example,
whether the model’s recommendation is
binding or if there is flexibility to deviate
from it. Not surprisingly, efforts at adoption
can meet resistance.
Instead, front-line employees need to be
involved at each stage of the development
process, from establishing the business
case to deciding what data to draw upon,

Analyzing analytics
Analytics has emerged from four trends. First is the exponential growth in data that a digital
world enables, including structured data that is machine readable and easily loaded into
databases and queried, and unstructured data such as video, text, social media, and
employee emails that is harder to collect, analyze, and process. In the past 18 months
alone, more data has been generated globally than in the entire previous history of mankind.
In the next five years, the amount generated will be three times more than has been
cumulatively generated to date.
The second trend relates to revolutionary advances in computer technology and to
analytics techniques, such as machine learning, that rely on automated, computer
program-driven pattern recognition. These techniques are far more predictive than
generalized linear modeling. With machine learning, algorithms “learn” from data and adapt
to new circumstances without being explicitly reprogrammed. The concept is to give the
algorithm “experiences” (training data) and a generalized strategy for learning, then let the
algorithm identify patterns, associations, and insights from the data—in short, to train the
system rather than program it.
Deep learning, a frontier area of research within machine learning, uses neural networks
with many layers (hence the label “deep”) to push the boundaries of machine capabilities.
Data scientists working in this field have recently made breakthroughs that enable
machines to recognize objects and faces, to beat humans in challenging games such
as chess and Go, and even to generate natural language. Digital giants such as Google,
Facebook, Intel, and Baidu, as well as industrial companies such as GE, are leading the
way in these innovations, seeing machine learning as fundamental to their core business
and strategy.
The third trend is the shift from batch processing to real-time processing, monitoring, and
visualization of data feeds. This trend will continue to change the behavior of the insured
and affect the operations of many core insurance functions such as underwriting and
pricing, claims, billing, and customer relationship management.
Finally, flowing from all this, is a complex ecosystem of new analytics vendors and solutions
that enable carriers to combine data sources, external insights, and advanced modeling
techniques in order to glean insights that were not possible before.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

77

how to integrate the output into working
patterns, and what new skills might be
needed. One large insurance carrier saw
a 30 percent increase in adoption rates
when front-line employees joined a crossfunctional team engaged in defining use
cases. They participated in workshops
to define hypotheses on the variables
with most predictive power, worked on
understanding and refining modeling
output, and finally integrated the output
with the business process.
The integration element is particularly
important and often particularly
challenging, given that it involves a
significant shift of mind-set away from
the old method of working. How will data
that reveals insights be presented? It is no
point sending quantities of it to the person
required to use it. Carriers will need to be
creative so that data is in a form that is
self-explanatory and prescriptive. It is also
important that analytics becomes part
of the work process, rather than being
an additional, separate task that busy
people are unlikely to complete. Better
that it be integrated directly into core tools
being used for, say, customer relationship
management and pricing.
Performance management
Early on, organizations are
understandably keen to see a return on
their investments. But too much focus on
certain metrics can impede progress. It is
hard, for example, to isolate the financial
impact of an analytics initiative from
that of other business initiatives such as
efforts to improve customer retention
based on digital marketing or strategic

78

The advance of analytics

projects—and trying to do so can become
an exercise in false precision. Diligently
tracking the impact of use cases in terms
of their adoption and satisfaction might
prove a better measure of early progress,
as well as an indication of when version 2.0
or 3.0 is needed. Comparing outcomes for
those who use the new models and those
who do not is also a helpful gauge.

The end-state is one
in which analytics
shifts from being
regarded as a business
aid to being seen as
a capability that sits
at the core of the way
business is conducted.
Phase 3: Achieving scale
The application of analytics often begins
within the pricing and underwriting
functions. Employees here are relatively
accustomed to modeling and datadriven analyses, and the potential to
improve previous practices should be
clear—be it by finding new variables,
exploring new modeling techniques, or
further automating processes. Eventually,
however, it needs to be deployed in all
businesses and functions. To reach that
point efficiently, leading organizations
use heat maps that indicate where to

prioritize efforts. They also find ways to
make sure the businesses work alongside
the analytics function, and involve top
management.

companies need a CoE with teeth to come
up with ideas and recommendations,
as well as businesses and domains that
shape and approve the CoE’s agenda and
the costs allocated to it.

Prioritization
Direct involvement of top management
The heat map should be drawn up on
the basis of three dimensions: the value
that analytics can deliver, their feasibility
(drawing on a large number of different
systems to collect data will make it
harder to capture value from a use case,
for example), and strategic relevance.
Importantly, the map needs to be updated
at least once a year to align with changing
strategic priorities and feasibility based on
the technology and data lessons learned
in the previous year.
Balancing business engagement with a
strong analytics function
As carriers master the execution of
use cases, so a permanent center of
excellence (CoE) needs to take shape
to support the businesses. Carriers can
wrestle with how best to position the CoE.
Should it be autonomous with its own
reporting and profit-and-loss statements?
Or should it function as an on-demand
resource? The advantage of the former is
that the CoE is likely to be more proactive
in developing analytics initiatives across
the organization and more accountable
for their success. The latter has the
advantage of more closely aligning the
CoE with the businesses’ agenda.
The best approach probably lies
somewhere between the two, making
sure there is strong business and analytics
leadership. Whatever structure chosen,

As the CoE scales up, senior management
needs to make clear that analytics
is a corporate priority, paying close
attention to the portfolio of initiatives and
understanding how it will achieve impact.
To promote take-up, executives can
encourage line leaders to contribute to
the pipeline of analytics ideas as part of
the annual planning process. And, while
understanding that returns on investment
might not be obvious within the first
few quarters, executives can highlight

79

quick wins and celebrate successes
that will prove the concept and maintain
momentum.

Phase 4: The analytics-driven
organization
The end-state is one in which analytics
shifts from being regarded as a business
aid to being seen as a capability that sits at
the core of the way business is conducted.
Indeed, it will become so ingrained in
daily work practices that the CoE is made
redundant. Various functions—claims,
distribution, underwriting—might still
exist, since the practical activities and
the skills required for them differ. But the
core decision-making and the analytics
engine that supports decisions are likely
to converge at a single point. When
that point is reached, all business and
strategy decisions are made with data and
analytics at their center.
At this stage it will make no sense
to measure success by returns on
investment. The business metrics
themselves become the markers of
success, be it price adequacy or loss,
expense and combined ratios, or the
quality of new-business growth. In
addition, analytics will firmly shape the
organization’s talent strategy, becoming
an integral part of multiple roles.

and the use cases emerging dictate
that gradual improvement is no longer
an option. Analytics will soon become
a core corporate capability, and those
carriers that leap ahead and bring it to
insurance are likely to capture an unrivaled
competitive advantage.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

81

McKinsey: Can you start by defining
robotic process automation (RPA)?
Leslie Willcocks: RPA takes the
robot out of the human. The average
knowledge worker employed on a back
office process has a lot of repetitive,
routine tasks that are dreary and
uninteresting. RPA is a type of software
that mimics the activity of a human being
in carrying out a task within a process.
It can do repetitive stuff more quickly,
accurately, and tirelessly than humans,
freeing them to do other tasks requiring
human strengths such as emotional
intelligence, reasoning, judgement, and
interaction with the customer.
There are four streams of RPA. The first
is a highly customized software that will
work only with certain types of process
in, say, accounting and finance. The
more general streams I describe in terms
of a three-lane motorway. The slow lane
is what we call screen scraping or web
scraping. A user might be collecting data,
synthesizing it, and putting it into some
sort of document on a desktop. You
automate as much of that as possible.
The second lane in terms of power is a
self-development kit where a template
is provided and specialist programmers
design the robot. That’s usually
customized for a specific organization.
The fast lane is enterprise/enterprisesafe software that can be scaled and is
reusable.
You can multi-skill each piece of
software. It’s lightweight in the sense that
you don’t need a lot of IT involvement
to get it up and running. Business
operations people can learn quite

82

quickly how to configure and apply the
robots. It’s lightweight also in that it
only addresses the presentation layer
of information systems. It doesn’t have
to address the business logic of the
underlying system or the data access
layer.

One major benefit of
RPA is “a return on
investment that varies
between 30 and as
much as 200 percent
in the first year.”
McKinsey: How is RPA different from
cognitive intelligence?
Leslie Willcocks: RPA deals with
simpler types of task. It takes away mainly
physical tasks that don’t need knowledge,
understanding, or insight—the tasks
that can be done by codifying rules and
instructing the computer or the software
to act. With cognitive automation, you
impinge upon the knowledge base that
a human being has and other human
attributes beyond the physical ability to
do something. Cognitive automation can
deal with natural language, reasoning,
judgement, with establishing context,
possibly with establishing the meaning of
things and providing insights. So there is a
big difference between the two.
In addition, whereas RPA is pretty ripe as
a technology, cognitive automation isn’t.

The value of robotic process automation: An interview with Professor Leslie Willcocks

I’ve not seen a wave of powerful cognitive
automation tools appear in the market and
not many companies are using them yet.

McKinsey: What are the business
benefits of RPA?
Leslie Willcocks: The major benefit we
found in the 16 case studies we undertook
is a return on investment that varies
between 30 and as much as 200 percent
in the first year. But it’s wrong to look just at
the short-term financial gains—particularly
if those are simply a result of labor savings.
That approach does not do justice to the
power of the software because there are
multiple business benefits.
For example, companies in highly
regulated industries such as insurance
and banking are finding that automation is
a cheap and fast way of applying superior
capability to the problem of compliance.
You also get better customer service
because you’ve got more power in the
process. A company that receives lots
of customer enquiries, for example, can
free staff to deal with the more complex
questions.
There are benefits for employees, too.
In every case we looked at, people
welcomed the technology because
they hated the tasks that the machines
now do and it relieved them of the rising
pressure of work. Every organization we
have studied reports that it is dealing with
bigger workloads. I think there will be an
exponential amount of work to match
the exponential increase in data—50
percent more each year. There is also
a massive increase in audit regulation
and bureaucracy. We need automation

just to relieve the stress that creates
in organizations. One online retailer
measures the success of RPA in terms
of the number of hours given back to the
business. So it’s not just the shareholders,
the senior managers, and the customers
who benefit but also employees.

McKinsey: Can you describe a process
where you have seen RPA in action?

To get started with
RPA, “you have to
pick the right process.
It has to be stable,
mature, optimized,
rules-based,
repetitive, and usually
high-volume.”
Leslie Willcocks: In an insurer we
studied, there was a particular process
where it used to take two days to handle
500 premium advice notes. It now takes
30 minutes. It worked like this: a range of
brokers would write business for clients,
and there was a central repository into
which the business written had to go, and
a process that someone had to manage
to get the premium advice note from the
broker into the repository. A number of
operations had to occur for that advice
note to be fully populated by all the data,
and the process operator might find that
the data had not been completely filled
out, perhaps because the advice note

83

wasn’t structured very well. So the data
had to be structured to standardize it so
that it could be a common document
like all the other advice notes. And if any
data was missing, that person might
have had to go back to the broker, or add
things from the systems of record in the
back office. Then, once the note was
complete and signed off by the process
operator, it went into the repository.

“In an insurer we
studied, there was
a particular process
where it used to take
two days to handle
500 premium advice
notes. It now takes
30 minutes.”
Now a lot of that sort of work can be
automated. But some of it requires
human intervention, human reasoning,
judgement. So an RPA engineer would
look at that type of process and say,
“Which bit can we automate?” The
answer is not everything—it can’t
structure the data. There may at
some stage be cognitive automation
technology that could structure the data
but RPA can’t, so the human being has
to structure the data at the front end
and create a pro forma ideal advice
note. Clearly, the RPA can’t deal with
exceptions either. The engineer has to
intervene and look at the exceptions and
create a rule to deal with them, so that

84

gradually you educate and configure
the RPA to do more and more work.
Eventually it can do 90 or 95 percent of
the work and very few exceptions have
to be dealt with by a human.

McKinsey: What are the most
important considerations for those
wishing to adopt RPA?
Leslie Willcocks: The most important
consideration is strategy. You can use
automation tactically for cost savings.
But if you use RPA as a broader strategic
tool, you get a lot more out of it. That’s
number one. Number two concerns
the launch. You need to get the C-suite
involved and appoint a really good
project champion, and you have to
pick the right process. It has to be
stable, mature, optimized, rules-based,
repetitive, and usually high-volume. Start
with a controlled experiment on a visible
bottleneck or pain point.
The third consideration is change
management—persuading the
organization to change and adopt
automation. It is a key issue from the
outset. And the fourth is building a
mature enterprise capability for RPA.
Long-term users have built centers of
excellence over time, usually within
business operations, and developed
skills and capabilities within that center.
They have people who assess the
feasibility of a proposal from a business
unit. They have people who configure
a robot, install it, and develop it, and
controllers who switch it on and off,
and plan its work and how it fits with
human work. They have some sort of
continuous improvement capability and
relationships with IT, governance, and

security. Organizations signing up to RPA
now should probably think about building
a center of excellence immediately.

McKinsey: How do companies choose
whether to implement an IT solution or
RPA? And how do the two departments
work together?
Leslie Willcocks: When organizations
consider proof of concept for RPA, they
look at the business case and compare
it to an IT solution. Often that’s pretty
unflattering for IT. In one organization we
looked at, the return on investment for
RPA was about 200 percent in the first
year and they could implement it within
three months. The IT solution did the same
thing but with a three-year payback period
and it was going to take nine months to
implement.

“In the longer term,
RPA means people
will have more
interesting work.
For 130 years we’ve
been making jobs
uninteresting and
deskilled.”

tool is usable, cheap, and doesn’t require
much IT skill to implement it’s a no-brainer
for the average operator in a business unit.
The reason IT gets worried is that they
know the disruptive, potentially disastrous
effects of people playing around with IT in
the organization and not understanding
how it’s going to upset infrastructure,
governance, security, and all the important
touchpoints that IT is held responsible for.
So it’s not surprising to find IT functions
in denial about RPA and what it can do.
It’s crucial therefore that IT is brought on
board early.

McKinsey: What do you think will be
the long-term impact of robotic process
automation?
Leslie Willcocks: In the longer term, RPA
means people will have more interesting
work. For 130 years we’ve been making
jobs uninteresting and deskilled. The
evidence is that it’s not whole jobs that
will be lost but parts of jobs, and you can
reassemble work into different types of
job. It will be disruptive but organizations
should be able to absorb that level of
change. The relationship between
technology and people has to change in
the future for the better and I think RPA
is one of the great tools to enable that
change.

Professor Leslie Willcocks was
speaking to Xavier Lhuer, an associate
partner in McKinsey’s London office.

In addition, many business operations find
going through IT frustrating because it’s so
busy. Often the business wants something
relatively small, but the IT function has
bigger fish to fry and the business has to
go to the back of the queue. So if an RPA

Introduction
Few CEOs need convincing that a digitally
enabled transformation of their companies
is the path to lower costs, growth, and
perhaps even survival as technology
and changing customer expectations
usher in new competitors, new value
drivers, and new business models. Nor
do they need telling that at the heart of a
digital transformation lies a cultural one,
equipping them to support new ways of
thinking and working. Rare is the CEO
who does not have cultural change high
on his or her agenda. But making that
change can seem a daunting task. Indeed,
McKinsey research has shown that 46
percent of financial services executives
feel cultural or behavioral change is the
biggest challenge they face in pursuing
their digital strategies.
Perhaps not surprisingly then, insurers
scored poorly when we measured their
cultural preparedness for a digital world
(see “Measuring your digital maturity”).

Building momentum for cultural
change
Being told to abandon old ways of thinking and working
and embrace without delay a new, and seemingly riskier,
digital culture can be unnerving for insurance companies.
But there are certain actions insurers can take to kick-start
change while minimizing the risks—and they do not have to
alter everything at the same pace.

86

Building momentum for cultural change

Cultural change is of course hard for any
long-established organization. And so it
is with insurers, the largest of which often
have a century-old record of creating
value for policyholders and shareholders.1
Unlike digital newcomers to the industry
that are building up a new business,
incumbents suspect change might
undermine the health of their existing one.
But beyond a general reluctance to
tamper with approaches that have served

companies in the United States based on 2015 premiums,

them well, there are more specific reasons
why cultural change can be particularly
hard for insurers to contemplate. To begin
with, the industry is highly regulated,
making insurers extremely cautious about
changing the way they work. There are
also certain aspects of a digital culture
that seem designed to undermine the
very things that have made insurance
companies so successful in the past.

“The companies that
will stand out are the
ones that are going to
find ways to move a
bit faster, at the pace
of the people they’re
insuring.”
— Scott Simony, head of
industry, Google
For example, a digital culture demands
an unswerving focus on customer needs.
And while there are exceptions, most
insurers have built their success on the
products they offer and their underwriting
skills, and by focusing on agent and
broker relationships—not customers. A
change of focus will therefore be hard
not only culturally, but also operationally:
administrative systems that are built

will need to be reconfigured, for instance.
And disturbing the long-established
intermediated distribution system carries
risks when 84 percent of sales in US

through agents or brokers.2, 3

Another digital mantra is experimentation
with new products and services—
requiring an ability to test and learn quickly
and a willingness to fail sometimes in order
to keep pace with market change. But the
idea of experimenting can make insurers
feel distinctly uncomfortable. They
spend a great deal of time meticulously
planning to ensure nothing they do
falls foul of regulatory or compliance
requirements, while the job of actuaries
is to be absolutely certain about the
carrier’s predicted losses. Will a new
culture that demands more speed and

experimentation put their value and
brands at risk?

Personal lines insurance has felt the
greatest impact from digital technology.
About 25 percent of people who
shop for auto insurance in the United
States, for example, buy online directly
from the carrier,4 with several direct
underwriters enjoying high growth and
profitability as a result. In the United
States, carriers that mostly sell directly
have the lowest combined ratios (losses
and loss-adjustment expenses divided

Of course, fear of change is no reason for
maintaining the status quo; history is full
of the corpses of companies that failed
to keep ahead of industry disruption.
Moreover, building a digital culture does
not mean destroying the skills and values
that have sustained the company. Rather,
it is about renewing that heritage with new
ways of thinking and working.
In addition, not everything has to alter
at the same pace. It is important to
distinguish between those segments of
the industry that are being transformed
quickly due to digital technology, where
cultural adjustment is thus urgent, and
those where change is slower. With these
parameters drawn, cultural shifts become
a less unnerving prospect. We do not
pretend there is an obstacle-free method
to instilling new ways of working and
thinking, and a digital culture will need to
take hold across the entire organization
before long. Nevertheless, certain actions
can kick-start change, and build support
and momentum for more.

by earned premiums) and enjoy some
of the highest growth in direct written
premiums (Exhibit 1). Arguably, their
success stems from their digital culture:
they have moved swiftly to embrace
technological innovation and focus on
changing customer needs. The outcome
is a high level of automation that enables
them to cut costs and price keenly, and a
determination to make buying insurance
easy for customers. Personal lines
insurers that fail to act similarly will surely
struggle to compete.

Wholesale, rapid change is neither
necessary nor possible. Culture, by
definition, takes time to root. To know
where to concentrate their efforts, insurers
should first consider how quickly digital
technology will affect different business
lines, then different functions within those
businesses. With this clear, they need to
improve those elements of a digital culture
where they are weakest.

Small commercial and simple term
life policies will be next to go the
direct route, both as customers grow
increasingly comfortable using virtual
channels and as the combination of
more data and technology enables
insurers to underwrite a large share of
these risks automatically, limiting the
need for intermediaries. Movement
is already apparent in the life
segment. Jennifer Fitzgerald, CEO of
PolicyGenius, a US-based aggregator of
term life quotes that aims to make buying
a life policy simple for consumers,
says people cannot understand why,
if they can do something as seemingly
complicated as their tax returns on their
own, they cannot figure out how to buy
a life insurance policy unaided. Haven
Life, a direct term life carrier in the United
States, offers an online application
process that takes less than 20 minutes
and makes an immediate decision on
term coverage up to $1 million.
Direct insurance for small commercial
is still rare, but a McKinsey survey of
more than 1,500 customers with small
commercial policies showed 60 percent
would be interested in buying directly.
Large commercial and specialty policies
will be the last to feel digital’s pull given
their complexity, the fact that brokers
fully control distribution, and the lesser
price elasticity of buyers compared to
other segments.
The function
It is already the case that consumerfacing functions such as marketing,
customer service, and claims can fulfill

90

Building momentum for cultural change

customers’ expectations only if they
are strongly digitally enabled. Because
these areas lend themselves to digital
experimentation, bringing about
change should not be overly difficult.
In marketing, for example, testing
messages and channels in order to
find out what is most effective presents
little risk for an insurer and can produce
answers quickly if A/B tests are used
(whereby two versions of a web page or
app are tried out to decide which one
performs better).

In the US, carriers
that mostly sell
directly have the
lowest combined
ratios and enjoy some
of the highest growth
in direct written
premiums.
Before long, however, companies will
need to be prepared to broaden their
change efforts to wherever the adoption
of digital technologies will enhance
competitiveness. In underwriting auto
insurance, for instance, real-time data
from the Internet of Things is leading to
more accurate pricing and risk selection
based on factors such as how fast a
person is driving or how hard they are
braking.

Strengths and weaknesses
Our research, as described in the box
below, suggests there are certain cultural
attributes that underpin a mature digital
environment and help drive superior
performance: an appetite for risk, a testand-learn mind-set, organizational agility,
and a desire to collaborate internally
and externally. Often, of course, these
cultural attributes are nurtured by certain
management or organizational practices.
Is the leadership team a good role model,
for example, or are functions set up in a
way that makes collaboration possible?
Various tools exist to help a company
ascertain its cultural starting position and
to indicate what needs to change and
what does not. These include McKinsey’s
Digital Quotient® and the Organizational
Health Index.

How to start
There are myriad ways to achieve a digital
culture, and the path each company
chooses will be unique. In general, there
are a number of actions companies can
take to kick-start change and speed them
on their way. Here we describe some that
reinforce three particular traits of highperforming digital companies—customercentricity, collaboration, and comfort with
(calculated) risk-taking.
Customer-centricity
Most businesses make decisions by
considering the business case and what
competitors are up to. Customer-centric

companies expand the framework
for decision making, putting the
customer’s point of view among their top
considerations. A question on the table
should always be, “How does this create
value for the customer?”

“You’ll be penalized
if you fail over a long
period of time, so fail
fast.”
— Eric Gewirtzman, CEO of
US online insurance agency
Bolt

At Amazon, for example, internal
presentations addressing business
problems are known as “working
backwards documents.” They start by
identifying how a proposed solution would
help improve the customer experience, be
it a better price, improvement in service,
or increased selection. Only then does the
presenter work backwards to present the
business case. It is a mind-set that some
insurance incumbents are endeavoring to
enforce. Sandeep Bakshi, the CEO and
managing director of Indian life insurer
ICICI Prudential, insists decisions made
by employees, whatever their rank, must
have one of three outcomes: improved
customer experience, more business, or
less risk.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

91

Many other businesses are engaging
customers in the product development
process, as there is no point asking what
they think of a new product or service
once it has been launched. If they are
dissatisfied, the development has been
a waste of time and money. Customer
needs should be understood at the outset
and feedback sought continually as the
product is developed.

Aviva has an internal
app that connects
employees to the
digital insight the
company has about
its consumers,
including live feeds
from social media or
curated calls from its
contact centers.
The more people reached by that
feedback, the better. To this end, Aviva has
an internal app that connects employees
to the digital insight the company has
about its consumers, including live feeds
from social media or curated calls from
its contact centers. “The purpose is to
give our people the ability to nibble on
real consumer feedback in an entirely raw
fashion without making a huge event of it,”
says chief digital officer Andrew Brem. “So
if you’ve got two minutes, you could read a
few tweets about what our customers are

92

Building momentum for cultural change

really saying to us or hear a few calls. The
idea is just to get our people connected
with our customers.”
A sure way to quicken a shift toward a
customer-centric culture, of course, is to
link employee compensation to metrics
that promote it—for example, metrics that
measure customer satisfaction directly,
or relate to other attributes of highperforming digital companies that affect
customers indirectly, such as speed to
market.
Collaboration
Collaboration is key not only because
it improves customer understanding
and decision making, but also because
it does so quickly. Our research shows
that more than 70 percent of insurers
take from six months to more than a year
to move a digital initiative from idea to
implementation. That is too slow. Scott
Simony, head of industry at Google,
explains why. “Insurance is a highly
regulated industry and it is not easy to
move quickly—but the fact is consumers
are moving at exceptional rates. So I’d
say that the companies that will stand out
are the ones that are going to find ways to
move a bit faster, at the pace of the people
they’re insuring.”
The way to achieve this pace and cut
development time dramatically is to set
up small, cross-functional teams that
take an agile approach to their work. In
a functional set-up, no one owns the full
customer experience and it can take
many work sessions to cobble together a
complete view of it. But a cross-functional
team, focused on the single goal of

improving the customer experience, can
do that rapidly.
The team, located together and working
in sprints to meet specific weekly
development targets, introduces early
prototypes or minimum viable products
(MVPs) that satisfy some—not all—
customer needs and can be improved
with customer feedback. If the team is also
empowered to make decisions without
seeking higher authority, it can cut delivery
time to as little as three to four months.

“It’s really hard to
stop a prototype
because it’s touchable,
feasible.”
— John Straw, Investor,
Bought by Many

Pure digital companies such as Spotify
were among the first to adopt this agile
approach, and insurance companies are
increasingly following their lead. John
Straw, an entrepreneur with investments
in the insurance industry, and formerly
the chairman of the digital advisory
board at UK travel agent Thomas Cook,
recalls his experience building a new
insurance website for the company.
“It was the prototyping part that made
the big difference. Rather than put the
plans through a committee, I took some
of my budget and went to a WordPress

developer and said, ‘Build me a working
prototype of the new insurance website.’
It took four weeks. I then took it to the
innovation committee, and it was relatively
simple from there. It’s really hard to stop
a prototype because it’s touchable,
feasible.”
Risk taking
On the subject of experimentation, the
inventor Thomas Edison is reputed to
have said, “I haven’t failed, I’ve just found
10,000 ways that won’t work.”
In a digital age, insurers need the same
mind-set. Concern over the costs of
failure can be minimized by the use of the
test-and-learn approach encapsulated
in MVPs—the frequent gathering of
feedback means a company will not
travel far in the wrong direction before
correcting course. United Services
Automobile Association, a US-based
insurer, now tests some 8,000 ideas each
year, generating roughly 250 patents.
Yet a culture that understands the value
of calculated risk-taking is one that also
accepts failure, and learns from set-backs.
Some organizations openly celebrate the
lessons learned in order to encourage
their employees to take risks.

Organizational changes and the role
of the CEO
The way a company chooses to organize
itself can significantly affect the pace of
cultural change. There are many options.
For example, some companies tackle the
cultural challenge from within, in the belief
that this is the only way it will take hold,
while others set up a separate division

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

93

for digital initiatives on the basis that they
need distance and a degree of autonomy
from the old business to flourish. That
division will look more like a start-up, with
its own goals, new digital talent, agile
processes, and the autonomy to act
toward these goals.

United Services
Automobile
Association, a USbased insurer, now
tests some 8,000
ideas each year,
generating roughly
250 patents.
Youse Seguros, the online insurance sales
platform of Brazilian insurance company
Caixa Seguradora, was set up in this way.
According to CEO Eldes Mattiuso, “It
was an essential move. You have to start
from scratch. You have to forget about the
rules of the old company and think like a
start-up. If I’d had to follow the traditional
product development procedures it would
have proved impossible to move quickly,
or to use the cloud, for example. It would
have taken us a year and a half to launch
a single product.” Eventually, once the
new culture takes hold, the division can be
reintegrated.

94

Building momentum for cultural change

Aside from these considerations, or
other actions a company might take,
the element that underpins all efforts
to embark upon cultural change, and
sustain it, is the commitment of the
CEO and the leadership team. It falls to
them to explain to the organization why
cultural change is so important and to
model the required behaviors. Some
gain inspiration and conviction for this by
visiting other companies around the world;
Dean Connor, CEO of Sunlife, takes his
management team to Silicon Valley once
a year, for example. Others spend time
with customers, then share what they
have learned, perhaps in a live-streaming
interview, or underscore the importance
of a changed culture in every meeting.
Whatever the specific tactics, it is the
demonstration of senior commitment that
is the surest way to bring about change.
Everything emanates from there.

A roadmap for a digital
transformation
No insurance company has yet completed a digital
transformation—one that fully harnesses the power
of digital technology to rethink every aspect of the
organization. But a number of carriers are making
remarkable progress, indicating the direction others
should take.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

95

The future of insurance will be digital.
That much is certain. The industry might
have been slow to feel digital technology’s
impact, protected by regulation, the size
of companies’ in-force portfolios, and
customers’ tendency to stay put with their
insurers. But the pressure is mounting. In
auto insurance, a handful of direct carriers
already enjoy the lion’s share of profits.
Disruption of other lines of business
will surely follow. Distribution channels,
products, underwriting technology,
competitors, and even business models
will shift as technology attacks market
inefficiencies and customer expectations
evolve.
Most insurers are responding to some
degree, albeit often cautiously. Some
see how digital technology will transform
pieces of the business, but find it harder
to envisage how the entire value chain
and business model might change.
They therefore content themselves
with investing in a new sales channel,
launching a service app, or automating
a few processes. At other carriers,
executives believe a transformation will not
be completed on their watch, because the
magnitude of change required will leave
no part of the organization untouched and
could take up to a decade. So why bet on
an uncertain future and risk cannibalizing
existing profits or alienating distributors
when they face more pressing issues,
such as regulatory compliance?
A growing number of executives, though,
are facing up to digital reality. They know
that digital technology can significantly
improve the performance of their current
business. They know that first-movers

96

A roadmap for a digital transformation

have an advantage. And they are keenly
aware that digital can give birth to entirely
new business models that shake up
sectors, leaving companies that fail to
adapt struggling to survive (newspapers
are a case in point). They have therefore
taken steps toward transforming their
businesses.

The CEO cannot
simply sanction a
digital transformation;
he or she must
communicate a vision
of what needs to be
achieved, and why.
They are far enough advanced to know
that each stage of the transformation will
present challenges. The first will occur at
the outset, when the CEO must set the
company on the right course for success.
More will present themselves during
the first six to 18 months—the launch
and acceleration phase—when initial
changes have to start taking root, and yet
others will arise during the long haul of
subsequent years, when digital initiatives
need to be scaled across the enterprise
and digital capabilities and new ways
of working become the lifeblood of the
company. Already, the industry’s digital
pioneers are meeting these challenges
and demonstrating to fellow CEOs ways

in which they can be overcome. And from
these early efforts and successes a set of
ten guiding principles is starting to emerge
(Exhibit 1).

1. Secure senior management
commitment
Any transformation will be dead in the
water if it does not have the commitment
of the CEO and the leadership team.
That statement seems almost glib,
given how often CEO commitment is
positioned as the solution to any major
challenge. But the CEO cannot simply
sanction a digital transformation; he
or she must communicate a vision of
what needs to be achieved, and why,
in order to demonstrate that digital is
an unquestionable priority, make other
leaders accountable, and make it harder
to back-track. Hence, in 2015, Allianz
announced that a key strategic growth

Defining value
To set a digital transformation on the right
course a company must place it at the
core of its agenda, and understand the
magnitude of that undertaking. It is not for
the fainthearted, but CEOs are heading
in the right direction if they grasp the
fundamental importance of heavyweight
management commitment, are willing
to make significant investments, and set
clear, ambitious targets.

A roadmap for a digital transformation

To set the organization’s sights at the
right level, investments need to be
linked to clear, ambitious targets. This
helps on three fronts. First, it signals the
magnitude of what digital technology
can deliver. Without targets, people who
find it hard to accept that the old ways of
doing things were massively inefficient
might be content to sign up for a 10
percent improvement in cycle time, for
example, when 100 percent is possible.
External benchmarking can help in this
respect by reinforcing the conviction that
cutting the time it takes to, say, process
a claims submission from 90 minutes to
20 is not good enough if someone else
has reduced it to four. A company can
be certain that if it does not match that
benchmark soon, others will.
Second, setting clear targets at the
outset prevents back-sliding when the
going gets tough. And third, it imposes
discipline on the process of deciding
which initiatives to pursue for maximum
impact.
Targets are needed for each source
of value creation—cost savings,
revenues, improved performance of
agents, and satisfaction of employees
and customers—and for new ways
of working and the new capabilities
required. They can be set, for example,
for the frequency of releases, the
percentage of processes that will

be automated, the percentage of
transactions that will be migrated from
one channel to another, the fraction of
new code that will be tested automatically,
the level of personalization that will be
achieved, and the number of campaigns
that will be run each month.

An insurer with
premiums worth
more than $5 billion
should expect to
hire between 20 and
100 new specialists
during the first
18 months of a
transformation.
3. Secure investment
Digital transformation is likely to require
significant investment. European insurer
Axa, for example, invested €950 million
over just two years. Our experience
suggests that in IT alone, companies with
outdated systems might need to double
their current spending over a five-year
period. That investment is likely to result
in lower profits for a while—but without
it there is a serious risk to profits in the
longer term. Importantly, companies
will need to allocate investment both
to improve the current business and to

build new businesses as the insurance
model evolves. To acquire expertise in
new fields and keep abreast of innovation,
for instance, insurers will need to invest
in partnerships or a venture capital arm,
perhaps both, as well as in their own
innovation labs.

Launch and acceleration
It is easy to launch change initiatives. It is
hard to keep them afloat and spawn more.
Often companies decide to fund several,
assign people, even set up separate
units. But then the initiatives fail to take
off and the old ways of doing business
continue much the same—at which point
executives wrongly conclude there is no
urgency as the market is not ready for
change.
To ensure early efforts thrive and build
momentum, companies should consider
carefully which projects to start with
and support them with the necessary
resources. Prerequisites include a highcaliber launch team often led by a chief
digital officer (CDO), consideration of
organizational structure, and the nurturing
of a digital culture.
4. Start with lighthouse projects
To win early support, companies should
start with projects that offer potential for
significant rewards with manageable risk.
Such projects include customer services
activities and the redesign of the claims
process, from the moment a customer
needs to file a claim to the moment
of reimbursement. Customers will be
delighted, cost savings can be as high as

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

99

40 percent, and effectiveness, measured
in return on investment, can rise by as
much as five percentage points.
5. Appoint a high-caliber launch team
The importance of securing a highcaliber launch team, often under a
CDO, cannot be overstated. A CDO
can prove invaluable in co-ordinating a
transformation—avoiding duplication by
devising a methodology for the redesign of
customer journeys that can be replicated
across the organization as digitization
efforts are extended, for example. He
or she can also ensure the appropriate
technology and skills are in place, decide
the sequence of the transformation,
monitor progress against targets, and
ensure that tactical day-to-day priorities
get the attention they need. But the
role of CDO is a temporary one. At the
end of the nineteenth century, many
companies employed a chief electricity
officer to ensure supplies of what was a
new industrial commodity. A few years
later, none did. Key recruits to the launch
team include designers to contemplate
customers’ unmet needs and inform the
creation of experiences, products, and
services; data scientists; scrum masters
to facilitate agile development; and
developers who can work in the modern
IT environment. Roughly, an insurer with
premiums worth more than $5 billion
should expect to hire between 20 and 100
new specialists during the first 18 months
of a transformation.
That is not a huge number, but the
competition for digital talent and the
advantage technology companies have
in attracting it makes finding people of the

100

A roadmap for a digital transformation

highest caliber a considerable challenge.
The scarcity of elite data scientists, for
example, has been a factor in some
insurers’ acquisitions of cutting-edge
artificial intelligence start-ups; $5 million
to $10 million per employee can be
commanded in these so-called “acquihire” deals.

“We have an
advantage when it
comes to culture. We
are a tech company
in the insurance
space, not an
insurance company
that plays with
technology.”
– Adam Lyons, founder and
CEO, TheZebra.com
One way to meet the challenge is to start
by hiring a renowned expert to serve as
an anchor hire, who will help to attract
others, on the basis that they will be drawn
to him or her more than they would be to
an insurer per se. Some companies go
further than hiring individuals and acquire
agencies that specialize in design thinking.
To help satisfy the expectations of their
ambitious recruits, companies might have
to adapt their traditional value proposition,
based on span of control, with a different

kind that promises empowerment in their
work on high-impact digital initiatives.
“The talent piece is essential,” says
Andrew Brem. “I’ve hired an entirely
new digital team. I’ve brought in people
from the world of gaming, from travel,
from retail, from pure digital. And they’ve
bought in a lot of people too. There are
some particular skills I’d call out. One
would be digital production design.
Another would be digital marketing on the
social side. And another would be data
analytics, particularly on the customer
side rather than risk.”
People leadership skills are essential too.
Transformation is not just about tipping
everything upside down, reinventing
products, and disrupting value chains. It
is partly about balancing old and new and
integrating fresh talent with old, valued
hands. As Clara Shih, founder and CEO
of “advisor marketing cloud” company
Hearsay has observed, digital-savvy
hires from outside the industry might ace
building a digital-direct, e-commerce
business, but are often ill-equipped to
modernize insurers’ existing channels,
where huge, value-creating opportunities
await. “The reason traditional agency
distribution hasn’t innovated is because
it’s very hard to find someone steeped in
digital who also understands field sales,
and vice-versa,” she says.
6. Organize to promote new, agile ways
of working
The way a company organizes itself is key
to a successful launch. Setting up a digital
unit independently of the organization will
promote new ways of working essential
for digital success, such as agile product

development, test-and-learn methods that
speed progress while keeping the focus
on customers, and cross-functional teams
that pool specific types of expertise.

“The reason
there hasn’t been
more innovation
within traditional
distribution ... has
been that it’s very
hard to find someone
with a digital
skill set who also
understands field
sales and vice versa.”
– Clara Shih, co-founder and
CEO of Hearsay Social
A digital unit can also help attract and
retain those specialists, while offering
them freedom from incumbents’
organizational constraints and the support
of like-minded colleagues. If such people
are simply parachuted into the existing
structures of incumbents they can
become bored and frustrated at the pace
of change. They need to be empowered to
make a swift impact, which often means
giving them authority to make their own
decisions.

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

101

Separating a digital component from
the rest of the organization is not entirely
the answer, however. To begin with,
newcomers can (unintentionally) run
roughshod over what is valuable in an
incumbent: the reason many insurance
companies have been around for more
than a century is that they excel at what
they do. They can also start to create
channel conflict, particularly if innovations
threaten to cannibalize revenue streams.
The digital unit therefore needs to be
reintegrated at some stage, and that
becomes more difficult as time passes.
Whatever the choice, the ultimate goal has
to be to enmesh the old and the new.

McKinsey research
has shown that 46
percent of financial
services executives
feel cultural or
behavioral change
is the biggest
challenge they face in
pursuing their digital
strategies.
7. Nurture a digital culture
We have touched upon how digital ways of
working and thinking—fast, collaborative,

102

A roadmap for a digital transformation

empowered—will be the default mode
of new recruits with digital skills. These
methods also need to take hold across the
organization, and now is the time to start
nurturing them.
So much needs to change. A focus on
customer needs rather than process
and procedure, continuous customer
feedback, comfort with testing and
learning and hence with occasional
failure, and collaboration—all are vital.
But insurers can be made to feel they are
being asked to jettison the things that
have made them successful and adopt an
untested culture. No wonder McKinsey
research has shown that 46 percent of
financial services executives feel cultural
or behavioral change is the biggest
challenge they face in pursuing their digital
strategies.
They are not, of course, being asked to
abandon the traits that have made them
successful, but to renew their heritage
with innovative ways of thinking and
working (see “Building momentum for
cultural change”). Brad Auerbach, US
industry manager at Facebook, describes
it as recalling what initially made them
successful. And there are relatively easy
ways to kick-start change and gain
support. For example, rather than making
decisions by considering the business
case or what competitors are doing, insist
that the starting point is “How does this
create value for the customer?” Moreover,
change can begin in areas where there are
fewer risks—in marketing, for example, by
testing messages and channels to find out
what is most effective.

“Agile principles
are now standard
operating procedure
for software design,
but they’re also
applicable any
time you need to
orchestrate a large
number of people
to get something
complex and multifaceted done over an
extended time frame.”
— Marcus Ryu, co-founder
and CEO at Guidewire
Software
Scaling up
At the 18-month point, companies
should be making good progress. They
should have a handful of initiatives up and
running and be starting to capture value.
But just when everything seems under
control is also the time to supercharge the
transformation and do everything on a
grander scale. The thoughtful sequencing
of subsequent initiatives is key to this. In
addition, close attention will need to be

paid to building more capabilities. And to
reap the full rewards of a transformation,
eventually an entirely new operating model
will be required.
8. Sequence initiatives for quick returns
Sequencing with a view to quick returns is
key to building scale fast. The more value a
transformation captures as it progresses,
the more it becomes self-funding and the
greater the support it garners. Often a
company’s approach is to let a thousand
flowers bloom. But this spreads scarce
resources thinly. Moreover, transformation
incurs costs at a time when competition
is probably putting pressure on margins.
Hence the imperative to thoughtfully
pursue a manageable number of digital
initiatives to tend the performance of the
core business while cultivating future
sources of growth (see “Capturing value
from the core”).
Initiatives that are strategically important,
pay back quickly, and reduce complexity
are the ones to prioritize. This almost
always means looking for ways to cut
costs—a counterintuitive notion for many
executives who tend to focus on digital
technology’s growth potential. But context
matters. A company’s financial pressures
will shape the sequencing to some
degree. So will its IT, if legacy systems
restrict initial choices. And companies
need to be flexible. It could prove hard to
recruit the particular people needed, while
technology and customer behavior will
continue to evolve.
Tracking returns is essential to ensure
all available value is captured. Often,

Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise

103

targets can be raised during the course of
the transformation as prototypes reveal
greater productivity improvements than
have been assessed on paper. And when
initiatives are successful and deliver the
intended financial benefits, the board and
top team should be emboldened to push
to achieve more. But while concentrating
effort and attention on what works well
matters, so does letting go of what does
not.
9. Build capabilities
By now it will be apparent that insurers
will have to invest in more than just digital
technologies themselves to scale up
digital initiatives. Marcus Ryu, co-founder
and CEO at Guidewire Software, contends
that it is only by modernizing core
operating platforms — most importantly
policy administration, billing, and claims
systems — that insurers can externalize
the data and business logic necessary to
deliver a satisfying digital experience for
the policyholder or distribution partner.
Skills as well as systems will need to be
boosted. But if a company struggles to
hire 20 to 100 new people for the launch
team, how should it go about hiring several
hundred? Searches are likely to extend to
developer communities and to technology
conferences and similar events. The quest
for talent might even lead companies
to establish partnerships with software
providers.
A huge internal training job will be
needed too. Business leaders will need
to understand IT’s strategic value—the

104

A roadmap for a digital transformation

reason one large European insurance
group has set up an IT literacy program
to educate and update business line
managers, while all newly appointed top
business managers must take a three-day
training module to help them understand
and capture IT’s strategic value (see
“Modernizing IT for a strategic role”).
Ultimately, however, it will be important
to help all employees rethink the way
they work, as the end result of a digital
transformation is the establishment of a
company-wide agile operating model.
10. Adopt a new operating model
Whatever structures a company chooses
initially, it will reach the stage when only
a fundamental organizational redesign
will do. Silos drawn along functional lines
have always been a drag on collaboration
and performance in large organizations.
In the digital age, when companies need
to reinvent the way they work on the fly,
an inability to connect all parts of the
organization to share data, expertise, and
talent can be crippling.

The only way forward
for a company is to
learn as it goes and
figure out how to
apply lessons as scale
is built.

That is why companies will have to lean
away from a traditional matrix structure
with rigid functional boundaries if the
transformation is to succeed. They will
need a network structure, organizing
around sources of value, with product
managers empowered to make decisions
with implications that cut across functions.
Teams will not be permanent. They will be
dissolved when they capture the value at
stake, then regroup around new sources of
revenue growth or cost reductions. Some
companies call them scrum teams, others
tiger teams, portfolios, or tribes. Whatever
the label, the ossified matrix is giving way
to a more agile one. In other words, the
entire organization, not just IT, will adopt an
agile approach to working. “Agile principles
are now standard operating procedure for
software design,” says Marcus Ryu, “but
they’re also applicable any time you need to
orchestrate a large number of people to get
something complex and multi-faceted done
over an extended time frame.”

afford insight into decisions relating to
technology architecture, data architecture,
and platforms. Customer satisfaction is
likely to jump. Cycle times will be shorter
and costs will fall. New ways to accelerate
revenue growth will reveal themselves. This
is the time to double down on efforts.
A closing thought, and perhaps one that
reframes the challenge: the term digital
transformation puts the emphasis on
technological change. But it becomes
clear to anyone who understands digital
technology’s potential that what is afoot is
less of a digital transformation and more
of a fundamental rethink of the corporate
model, for which digital technology is the
catalyst. Sources of revenue, efficiency, and
the organization’s structure are all up for
scrutiny, as are talent models, which need
to offer more flexible, more empowering,
and more rewarding career paths. Some
executives might feel the reframing makes
the challenges more daunting still, others
that it makes the opportunities more
exciting. We are in the second camp.
